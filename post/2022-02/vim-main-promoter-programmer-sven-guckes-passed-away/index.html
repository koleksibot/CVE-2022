      <p>Bram Moolenaar, the father of Vim, has <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/MJBKVd-xrEE/m/joVNaDgAAgAJ">announced</a> the death of core maintainer Sven Guckes on the mailing list.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2022/02/23/021dac37edcb41d7b24c926f3fc0f8a8.png" alt="Bram Moolenaar announced"></p>
<p>Sven Guckes died on February 20, 2022 in Berlin, according to the body of the email. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor in December 2021, and because there was nothing surgeons could do about it, Sven was transferred to a hospice at the end of January, where a group of friends accompanied Sven through his final days. They chatted until their last moments, and Sven smiled afterwards, but shortly afterwards his breathing stopped and he passed away peacefully.</p>
<p>Bram Moolenaar, the father of Vim, recalls some moments related to Sven, who was very active in the Vim development team as a student in the 90s. He registered the home page for the Vim project that is still used today: <strong><a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim.org</a></strong> .</p>
<p>Vim is more feature-rich than common editors, but it also has a higher barrier to entry and a learning curve for beginners (after all, many people <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/">can&rsquo;t quit</a> the first time they use it). Sven was so passionate about Vim and wanted to bring it to more developers that he came up with the idea of <strong>&ldquo;What is Vim? &ldquo;</strong> - a 6KB document to explain He also actively helped write a tutorial on Vim.</p>
<p>Bram Moolenaar says that although he&rsquo;s only met Sven a few times, he&rsquo;s impressed by the never-ending enthusiasm Sven carries with him. So Bram would like to dedicate the upcoming Vim 9.0 release to Sven as a tribute.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2022/02/23/a47d0a4daf0c4779916a961412d78837.png" alt="Sven Guckes"></p>
<p>In addition to promoting Vim, Sven is active in many other free software projects (such as Vi and Mutt) and speaks at public events.</p>
<p>Sven enjoys making friends and has friends all over the world because he is willing to help them in any way to solve software problems and real-life problems, and many developers <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30410077">share</a> their experiences of having benefited from Sven&rsquo;s help &ndash; but unfortunately most of this help was done online, so they didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to meet Sven and thank him in person.</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s pay tribute to Sven Guckes, a Vim maintainer who actively promoted open source and made the world a better place with his kind words and actions.</p>
<p>R.I.P.</p>
