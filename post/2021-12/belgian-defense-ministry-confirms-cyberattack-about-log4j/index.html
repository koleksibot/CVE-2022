      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2021/12/20/defensie-slachtoffer-zware-cyberaanval-deel-netwerk-al-dagen-pl/">Belgian VRT news report</a>, earlier this week, the Belgian Ministry of Defense admitted that they had suffered a serious cyber attack based on the Apache Log4j-related vulnerability we reported previously. The strong cyber attack paralyzed some activities of the Belgian Ministry of Defense, such as the mail system which was down for several days.</p>
<p>Olivier Séverin, a relevant Belgian spokesman, said, &ldquo;The Ministry of Defense discovered on Thursday that its computer network with Internet access was under attack. We then quickly took quarantine measures to isolate some of the affected devices, <strong>the immediate priority is to keep the defense network operational</strong>.&rdquo; He then added &ldquo;Throughout the weekend, our team was mobilized to contain the impact of this attack. We will continue to monitor the attack activity and warn our partners,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The severity of the Log4j-related vulnerability speaks for itself as it affects national information security levels. In addition to Belgium, according to Check Point Software Technologies, an Israeli cybersecurity solutions provider, a group of hackers linked to the Iranian regime, known as Charming Kitten or APT 35, used a vulnerability in Log4j to launch attacks on seven targeted websites or groups of sites in Israel, including government sites .</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-22-02">ordered</a> that all Federal civilian agencies &ldquo;must patch their Log4j-related systems by Christmas&rdquo;. The Singapore Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) also held an emergency meeting with the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) department to address the Log4j vulnerability and issued a <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/Advisories/ad-2021-010">warning notice of the vulnerability</a> to closely monitor the development of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>At the same time, China&rsquo;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is also paying close attention to the development status of the vulnerability and has issued a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/xwdt/gxdt/sjdt/art/2021/art_7587d13959e24aeb86887f7ef60d50d3.html">Cybersecurity Risk Alert on the significant security vulnerability of Apache Log4j2 component</a>&rdquo; notice &ndash; all of which means that the Log4shell vulnerability is a global network security problem.</p>
