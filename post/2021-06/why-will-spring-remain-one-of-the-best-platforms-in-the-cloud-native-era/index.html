      <p>Back in <code>2015</code>, the keynote at the <code>SpringOne</code> 2015 conference in Washington was <code>Cloud Native Enterprise</code>. The slogan of that conference was also <code>Cloud Native</code> and the posters were all over the place with <code>Cloud Native</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2021/06/24/c0992cb0cc41446496a5bb0aae776410.png" alt=" "></p>
<p>You may wonder how you could call it <code>Cloud Native</code> when containers weren&rsquo;t popular at that time. Although many people may not have the same understanding of <code>Cloud Native</code>, more and more people believe that &ldquo;Cloud native is about culture, not containers&rdquo;. It is a culture of software development, and even if there is a <code>Serverless</code> or <code>WebAssembly FaaS</code> platform based on <code>V8</code> isolation, it is still in the realm of cloud native.</p>
<p>And in the trend of cloud-native, <code>Spring</code> has done a lot of things, such as supporting the distributed architecture of <code>Spring Cloud</code>, which is basically a necessary framework for <code>Java</code> applications to be distributed and cloud-based. Various cloud vendors have <code>Spring Cloud</code> docking versions, such as <code>Spring Cloud Alibaba</code>, <code>AWS</code>, <code>Azure</code>, <code>GCP</code>, etc. <code>Spring Cloud</code> greatly simplifies the docking of Java applications and cloud services.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that the <code>Spring</code> ecosystem has been at the forefront of the growing popularity of microservices. Many of you may wonder: we know all these previous achievements of <code>Spring</code>, but there seems to be no development in the last two years, can <code>Spring</code> continue to lead the technology trend?</p>
<p>In fact, the reason for this confusion is that when we talk about cloud-based and cloud-native environments for development, the general focus is more on the choice of technology stack, and the main issue behind this is the cost.</p>
<p>Every developer or small and medium-sized company wants to buy fewer cloud resources to do more things, the most important of which are memory and CPU. memory consumption requirements are small, try to choose some lightweight development framework if it can be compiled into a standalone executable; and consider a framework with efficient and fully asynchronous language, which can ensure full use of CPU and avoid waste caused by threads waiting, etc.</p>
<p>On balance, many people would prefer technology stacks such as <code>Rust</code>, <code>Node.js</code>, and <code>Golang</code>. And <code>Java</code> is slow to start, consumes a lot of memory, seems to be more expensive, and seems to be less suitable for the next cloud-native era.</p>
<p>So as the <code>Spring</code> ecology based on the Java language, can it still adapt to new development methods such as <code>Cloud Native</code>, <code>Serverless</code>, <code>Faas</code>, etc., and will it still be the best choice of platform in the cloud-native era?</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll break this down for you from 5 perspectives: the evolution of <code>Java</code> and <code>JDK</code>, a JVM language full of healthy competition, <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> for mature service-oriented architectures, and <code>Spring Reactive</code> for making event-driven architectures easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="1-development-of-java-and-jdk">1. Development of Java and JDK</h2>
<p>We know that <code>Spring</code> is based on the <code>Java</code> framework, and that the <code>JDK</code> is the foundation for running <code>Java</code> programs. To explore the question &ldquo;will Spring be one of the best platforms for cloud-native&rdquo;, we need to see how the <code>JDK</code> base is and whether it provides a good foundation for <code>Spring</code> to evolve with the times.</p>
<p>The first is version iteration. Now the development speed of <code>OpenJDK</code> is very fast, before it was a major version in three years, now it is a version in half a year. Many users lament that it is almost <code>Java 17</code> and they are still using <code>Java 1.8</code>. We all say that software development should be small steps, this is a good way to develop: small steps, fast feedback, rapid iterative development. Similarly there is <code>JavaScript</code> a year a version, <code>TypeScript</code> a year three versions, <code>Java</code> a year two versions, can be said to be a very good pace.</p>
<p>The second is the update of <code>JDK</code> features. If you pay attention to the <code>JDK</code>, it is easy to find that more and more features are being incorporated into the <code>JDK</code>, such as the lightweight thread <code>Loom</code> project that resembles a concurrent thread, the <code>Panama</code> project that improves the support for <code>Native</code> calls (SIMD support), the more advanced <code>GC</code> algorithm, and so on.</p>
<p>In response to the <code>Java</code> slow startup and memory consumption problems we mentioned earlier, <code>Oracle</code> has introduced <code>GraalVM</code> based on <code>OpenJDK</code>, which can run <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>Ruby</code> and other languages directly in <code>JVM</code>, a veritable <code>Ployglot JVM</code>. In addition, <code>GraalVM</code> also provides the <code>Native Image</code> feature, which can convert <code>Java</code> code into standalone executable programs. <code>Spring</code> has also introduced the <code>Spring Native</code> project, which makes it very easy to <code>native-image</code> a <code>Spring Boot</code> application, so that <code>Spring</code> applications start faster and consume less memory. A <code>native-image</code>ized <code>Spring</code> application will meet the needs of every developer or small and medium-sized company that wants to be <code>cloud-based and less expensive</code>. Even for <code>Java</code> command line applications, <code>GraalVM</code> has a very good solution - <code>Picocli</code> + <code>GraalVM Native Image</code> + <code>upx</code>, which compiles <code>Java</code> applications into more convenient executables.</p>
<p>The following chart shows the list of <code>GraalVM</code> multilingual and <code>Native Image</code> support, as follows.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2021/06/24/ab402fb972be46798fd82388b7746818.png" alt="GraalVM"></p>
<p>In addition, various cloud vendors are also active in <code>JDK</code> development, such as <code>AliJDK</code>, <code>Amazon Corretto</code>, <code>Azul</code>, etc. These are all very good for <code>JDK</code> development.</p>
<p>So, for <code>Spring</code>, the foundation of <code>JDK</code> is still very solid.</p>
<h2 id="2-a-jvm-language-with-healthy-competition">2. A JVM language with healthy competition</h2>
<p>The <code>JDK</code> does not only support <code>Java</code> as a programming language, on the contrary, it can support a variety, such as <code>Kotlin</code>, <code>Scala</code>, <code>Groovy</code>, etc. Here we call it a JVM language in unison. At present, JVM languages are in a state of healthy competition.</p>
<p>We know that each language has its own usage scenario that it is good at. In the cloud native era, multi-language development support is very important and developers need to choose different development languages based on the actual business scenario. Both the <code>JVM</code> languages and the languages supported by <code>GraalVM</code> can be directly integrated with <code>Spring</code>, making it easy for developers to make full use of the <code>Spring</code> technology stack for development.</p>
<p>One of the best language support for <code>Spring</code> is <code>Kotlin</code>. The integration of <code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Spring</code> has penetrated into all aspects of the framework, such as <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Kotlin</code> integration, <code>Spring Webflux</code> support for <code>Kotlin Coroutines</code> &amp; <code>Flow</code>, <code>Spring Data</code>, <code>SpringIntegration</code>, <code>SpringCloud Function</code>, etc. also include support for <code>Kotlin</code>, these all achieve deep integration of <code>Kotlin</code>, the purpose is to make the language and framework better combined to improve development efficiency. In addition, <code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Scala</code> are also languages that are well integrated with <code>Spring</code>.</p>
<p>Because the three languages <code>Java</code>, <code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Scala</code> are very well integrated in <code>Spring</code>, I will specify them next to help you have a clearer perception of the current development of the <code>JVM</code>    language.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>The development of <code>Java</code> language is still very fast, along with the development of <code>OpenJDK</code>, <code>Java</code> will launch a version in half a year, and each version will be accompanied by syntax upgrade, standard library upgrade, etc., which greatly facilitates the developers. From <code>Java 9</code> to <code>16</code>, many syntax and feature enhancements have been completed, such as the <code>var</code> keyword (local variable type derivation), <code>Text block</code>, <code>Pattern Matching for instanceof</code>, <code>Record</code>, <code>sealed interface</code>, etc.</p>
<h3 id="kotlin">Kotlin</h3>
<p>Although <code>Kotlin</code> is not exactly for <code>JVM</code>, it also includes <code>Native</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, etc., but <code>Kotlin</code> support for <code>JVM</code> and <code>Android</code> is currently the most characteristic and stable among many <code>Kotlin</code> platforms.</p>
<p>Now <code>Kotlin</code> is growing very fast and has incubated several sub-projects, such as the latest <code>Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile</code> (one set of code to support multiple mobile platforms), <code>Kotlin Compose for Desktop</code> (one set of code to develop desktop applications for multiple operating systems) and so on. Of course, the most notable of these changes is the introduction of <code>Kotlin intermediate representation (IR)</code> in <code>Kotlin 1.5</code>. With the new <code>IR</code>, <code>Kotlin</code> code can be compiled and exported to a variety of target platforms with better programs, such as the <code>Kotlin WebAssembly</code>.</p>
<h3 id="scala">Scala</h3>
<p>Scala 2 was released in March 2006, which is a very long time ago. The good news is that <code>Scala 3.0</code> has been released in <code>May</code>, 2021. <code>Scala 3</code> adds new features while removing some obscure features from <code>Scala 2</code>, with the aim of making <code>Scala</code> better to use. If you are interested, you can keep an eye on the official website of <code>Scala3</code>.</p>
<p>Another core change in <code>Scala 3</code> is the adjustment of the compiler, named <code>TASTy</code>, which stands for <code>Typed Abstract Syntax Trees</code>, with the following structure:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2021/06/24/4757f606c4944c139adab2841c18b03b.png" alt="TASTy"></p>
<p>With the help of <code>TASTy</code>, there is already <code>Scala.js</code> and it is not surprising that <code>Scala WebAssembly</code> will follow.</p>
<p><code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Scala</code> are very friendly to functional programming, in this point are to make up for the shortcomings of <code>Java</code>. In addition, <code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Scala</code> also support <code>JavaScript</code> compiled output, which is very helpful for <code>Serverless</code> platforms based on <code>V8</code>, such as <code>Cloudflare</code>&rsquo;s S<code>erverless</code> platform. In addition, <code>Kotlin</code> and <code>Scala</code> are also actively exploring <code>WebAssembly</code> support, which are good news for supporting <code>Web</code> development.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many more <code>JVM</code> languages, such as <code>Groovy</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, etc., which are also actively developing. These <code>JVM</code> languages compete with each other and learn from each other, which is all very good news for developers.</p>
<p>With the <code>JDK</code> and <code>JVM</code> languages that <code>Spring</code> relies on out of the way, let&rsquo;s talk about two very successful projects in <code>Spring</code>, <code>SpringBoot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code>.</p>
<p><code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> are two very successful projects that are basically used by Internet companies based on the <code>Java</code> technology stack. In addition, if you have been following <code>Spring</code>s top evangelist <code>Josh Long</code>&rsquo;s talks recently, you will see that he has been talking about <code>Spring Reactive</code> and he has written a book called <code>&lt;&lt;Spring Reactive&gt;&gt;</code></p>
<p>So why do <code>Spring Boot</code>, <code>Spring Cloud</code> and <code>Spring Reactive</code> get so much attention?</p>
<p>We know that there are two very important architectural solutions for cloud native, one is service-oriented architecture and the other is event-driven architecture. The service-oriented architecture is usually based on a synchronous request/response model, which is the goal of <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> to support this feature; the event-driven architecture is based on an asynchronous message model and message routing, which is the core of the <code>Spring Reactive</code> project to support this architecture.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll show you exactly how <code>Spring</code> supports these two important architectural solutions in cloud-native, and with that, you&rsquo;ll also get a clearer picture of the three important projects in <code>Spring</code>, <code>Spring Boot</code>, <code>Spring Cloud</code> and <code>Spring Reactive</code>.</p>
<h2 id="3-mature-service-oriented-architecture-for-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud">3. Mature Service-Oriented Architecture for Spring Boot and Spring Cloud</h2>
<p>Usually, applications under cloud-native are inclined to microservice design, and the core elements of microservice design are service-oriented architecture design and application programming interface (API) management. <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> aim to support this feature, and these two projects have been so successful that Internet companies based on the <code>Java</code> technology stack are basically using them.</p>
<p>We know that the most typical structure of a service-oriented interface is the request/response pattern, especially the Request/Response pattern for the Web. Of course, remote RPC request/response is also in this category, such as HTTP REST, gRPC and Dubbo.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the service oriented architecture design in <code>Spring</code>, <code>SpringMVC</code> can support <code>Web</code> and <code>HTTP REST API</code> very well, and also includes support for <code>OpenAPI</code>. Other <code>RPC</code> classes of communication are also supported by the corresponding <code>Spring Boot starter</code> and there is a corresponding <code>starter</code> component in <code>Spring Boot</code> which makes development very easy. If you want to expose other forms of services, such as <code>Web Service</code> and <code>SOAP</code> traditional services, you can also reach them through the <code>Spring Web Services</code> (spring-ws) project.</p>
<p>Another feature, <code>API</code> management, is mainly related to service governance and service consumer invocation, and the corresponding core technology stack is mainly the <code>Spring Cloud</code> project. The <code>Spring Cloud</code> provides various basic settings for service architecture and <code>API</code> management, such as service registration discovery, complex balancing, <code>API Gateway</code>, break protection, etc. These technology stacks facilitate better management and governance of services, and also allow better invocation of services on the consumer side.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, the typical architecture for service-oriented architecture and API management, corresponding to the <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> technology stacks, is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2021/06/24/055f6cd2ef914131bfd74e2d01a115c7.png" alt="Spring Cloud"></p>
<p>If your architecture is service-oriented, such as involving service orchestration, service governance and <code>API Gateway</code>, then <code>Spring Cloud</code> is a very good choice, with complete features, stable framework, good documentation and hands-on experience such as Alibaba. If your company is based on <code>Java</code> technology stack, then <code>Spring Cloud</code> is the best support and practice to implement microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Alibaba has open sourced <code>Spring Cloud Alibaba</code> since July 2018, and as of today, it has gained over 19,000 STARs, which is already more than all other implementations combined. As we can see from the <code>&lt;&lt;2020 Open Source Digitization in Microservices Report&gt;&gt;</code> published by X-lab Open Labs, <code>Spring Cloud Alibaba</code> has become the most active and popular <code>Spring Cloud</code> implementation with the most complete tool chain. You can consider it in your selection process.</p>
<h2 id="3-making-event-driven-architecture-easier-to-use-with-spring-reactive">3. Making Event-Driven Architecture Easier to Use with Spring Reactive</h2>
<p>While we talked about Spring&rsquo;s support for service-oriented architecture earlier, there is another architectural pattern, which is event-driven architecture. Event-driven architecture is widely considered to be the preferred architectural solution for cloud natives, so how does Spring support this? This brings us to the <code>Spring Reactive</code> project, the core of which is supporting event-driven architecture.</p>
<p><code>Spring Reactive</code> is geared towards asynchronous messaging, messaging or events is the premier architectural pattern for the Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP), you may have heard of the Spring Enterprise Integration (SpringIntegration) project, which is primarily responsible for enterprise integration. The purpose of <code>Spring Reactive</code> is to make event-driven architecture design the preferred application architecture, and to make it simpler.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an aside: I&rsquo;ve talked to some senior <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> programmers, and they&rsquo;re all very familiar with various service-oriented interface designs, even down to the code level details, but when it comes to the Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP), they all say it&rsquo;s <code>Martin Fowler</code>s famous masterpiece, and when asked if they use things like <code>Apache Camel</code> or <code>Spring Integration</code> in their systems, they all say the service-oriented architecture is now meeting business needs.</p>
<p>So here is a question, so well-known EIP, ESB or EDA why not adopted in the architecture design? Is the threshold too high, or is it just a pure theory, completely out of practice?</p>
<p>In the service-oriented architecture design, it is basically based on the service interface invocation, and the invocation is synchronous, so service orchestration and API management play a very important role. Of course, in the service-oriented architecture design, we will also introduce some message-driven design, with the help of Kafka or other MQ systems, to deal with some asynchronous or data analysis scenarios, such as sending an email after user registration, triggering events for security audit after user login, triggering incremental indexing of search engines after product information or price modification, triggering various notifications after users place orders, etc.</p>
<p>Service-oriented has its benefits, but there are very many problems to solve, such as non-blocking, service registration and discovery, high performance, and easy integration, which is why many experts have proposed that event-driven architecture is the mainstream in cloud-native scenarios.</p>
<p>Event-driven architectures don&rsquo;t involve service registration and discovery as the responsible mechanisms, message-based routing is easy, asynchronous messaging is higher performance (and of course your bill is smaller), various SaaS services are simpler to integrate (EventBridge products), FaaS triggers are easy, and so on. If you want to learn more, check out the book <code>&lt;&lt;Building Event-Driven Microservices&gt;&gt;</code>. Here is a posting of Redhat&rsquo;s recommended event-driven architecture design based on microservices thinking, as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/b0xt/sobyte-images/2021/06/24/5afe54ceb3d84c3ea5535e6121ee28f1.png" alt="Building Event-Driven Microservices"></p>
<p>From this diagram we can see that all interactions between systems are communicated through messages. Instead of an interface-oriented request/response design that handles Request/Response requests from different applications, microservices are constantly processing messages from Brokers in an asynchronous manner.</p>
<p>At this point, you may understand that if <code>Cloud Native</code> is centered on event-driven design architecture, then <code>Spring Reactive</code> aims to make event-driven architecture easy to use and convenient to develop, which is the same as <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Cloud's</code> support for service-oriented architecture. In addition these two architectures are not contradictory, they can coexist and complement each other.</p>
<p>To achieve a better event-driven architecture, two foundations are missing: asynchronization and messaging. Asynchronization can solve the problem of thread waiting, while the message and its message routing, can be a good way to achieve loose coupling of applications. Currently more and more products use asynchronous messaging solution, a variety of messaging products middleware since needless to say, we are familiar with the HTTP/2 are based on asynchronous message communication.</p>
<p>So why asynchronization? We know that the model of message processing and synchronous service calls are different, such as the <code>Event Loop</code> and <code>Actor model</code> of message processing, both of which are very efficient ways of processing messages, and if we have to deal with synchronous service calls based on thread pools in the process of message processing, it will inevitably affect the model and performance. Of course it is not completely impossible to have synchronization, just try to avoid too many scenarios of synchronous service calls.</p>
<p>There is a lot of work to be done in <code>Spring</code> around asynchronization and messaging scenarios, and we all know that Java is very lagging behind on asynchronization support. <code>Java 1.8</code> added the <code>CompletionStage</code> interface, <code>Java 9</code> added <code>Reactive Stream</code> support intervened with <code>Flow</code>. Everyone has been concerned about the lightweight threaded <code>Loom</code> project is still under development and is expected to be released until <code>Java 17</code>.</p>
<p>So most of the current Java project projects will choose <code>Reactive</code> framework, of course <code>Spring</code> team developed <code>Reactor</code> framework, adding <code>Reactor</code> to <code>Netty</code>, <code>Kafka</code> and other adaptations to ensure that from the bottom is asynchronous, so that is the reason for the name <code>Spring Reactive</code>.</p>
<p>The next scenario is what we all see, <code>Spring Webflux</code>, <code>Spring Integration</code>, <code>Spring Data</code> and many other projects have added support for asynchronization, all these adjustments, is to ensure that from the bottom is fully asynchronous, you can understand the 5G non-independent networking and independent networking two You can think of it as both non-standalone and standalone networking for 5G, but <code>Spring</code> has chosen the <code>Reactive</code> standalone networking, standalone ecological approach, and of course the workload is very large. This involves two very big problems: database and distributed communication.</p>
<p>Currently most <code>NoSQL</code> products provide an asynchronous interface, asynchronous access to <code>NoSQL</code> products without any problems. Although <code>NoSQL</code> is developing rapidly, it still hasn&rsquo;t shaken the position of database, we all know that the specification of database access in <code>Java</code> is <code>JDBC</code>, but <code>JDBC</code> is a synchronous interface, so <code>Spring</code> started <code>R2DBC</code> project, the purpose is to be able to access the database with <code>Reactive</code> asynchronous interface, at present, the experience of using JDBC and R2DBC in The experience of using <code>JDBC</code> and <code>R2DBC</code> under the <code>Spring</code> framework is almost the same.</p>
<p>Here I synchronize two news with you: <code>Spring 5.3</code> has built-in <code>R2DBC</code> support, that is <code>spring-r2dbc</code>, and <code>spring-jdbc</code> side by side. We all like to use <code>MySQL</code> database, also launched <code>mariadb-r2dbc</code> 1.0.0 stable version, <code>Oracle</code> also launched <code>R2DBC</code> version of the driver. Of course the <code>DB</code> framework in <code>Java</code>, <code>Spring JPA</code>, <code>MyBatis</code>, etc. have added adaptations to <code>R2DBC</code>. <code>Hibernate</code> also launched <code>hibernate-reactive</code> project (based on <code>Vert.x database</code>), although not based on <code>R2DBC</code>, but is also fully asynchronous.</p>
<p>Another issue is distributed communication, which plays a very important role in the microservices architecture. Spring has always mainly supported <code>HTTP</code>, but the <code>HTTP</code> protocol is mainly designed for browsers and the advantages of communicating between back-end services are not obvious, and there is no performance advantage. Of course <code>gRPC</code> based on <code>HTTP/2</code> asynchronous messaging is a good choice, but <code>Spring</code> has never had built-in <code>gRPC</code> support, but of course this is not a big problem for most developers, and the third-party <code>grpc-spring-boot-starter</code> does a very good job</p>
<p>If you follow <code>Spring</code> releases you should know that subsequent versions of <code>Spring 5.2</code> have chosen the <code>RSocket</code> communication protocol and built <code>RSocket</code> into the <code>spring-message</code> project. Why? <code>RSocket</code> is a fully asynchronous binary messaging protocol that provides a complete communication model and is peer-to-peer, which is a good match for event-driven architectures, which is why <code>Spring Reactive</code> has incorporated <code>RSocket</code> into the core of <code>Spring</code>. <code>Spring</code> and Ali team plays a leading role.</p>
<p>There is a <code>CloudEvents</code> specification under <code>CNCF</code>, which mainly addresses event communication in heterogeneous systems. Messages and events are consistent in data structure, both are <code>Headers</code> and <code>Payload(data)</code> structures, and include message header extensions. With the latest <code>cloudevents-java SDK 2.1</code>, <code>Spring messaging</code> adds support for <code>CloudEvents</code> and supports codec support for the <code>CloudEvent</code> interface, unifying and integrating messages and events to be handled in <code>Spring</code>. <code>CloudEvents</code> and messages in <code>Spring</code> is much easier.</p>
<p>and enterprise integration-related products, such as <code>Apache Camel</code>, <code>Alpakk</code> based on <code>Akka</code>, <code>MuleSoft</code>&rsquo;s <code>Mule 4</code>, <code>Spring Integration</code>, etc., which all provide integration with <code>Reactive</code> and can be said to work seamlessly with <code>Spring Reactive</code>.</p>
<h2 id="5-summary">5. Summary</h2>
<p>Going back to the question of the article, why will <code>Spring</code> remain one of the best platforms in the cloud-native era? To summarize, <code>Java</code> and <code>JDK</code> development is in a very good place, and the <code>JVM</code> language is growing and competitive. Mature <code>Spring Boot</code> and <code>Spring Cloud</code> have made service-oriented architecture design easy to use, and <code>Spring Reactive</code> has made event-driven architecture more accessible while allowing more enterprise systems to complete interfacing with <code>Spring Reacitve</code>, whether it&rsquo;s an <code>IoT</code> device, <code>ESB products</code>, <code>SaaS</code> or cloud services, etc.</p>
<p>For microservices scenarios, <code>Spring Cloud</code> provides a mature architecture-oriented service foundation, and <code>Spring Reactive</code> is an event-driven architecture for the future, not to say, of course, that service-oriented architecture is obsolete, in fact service-oriented architecture is very successful, but in a cloud-native or new <code>Serverless</code> environment, it may make more sense to have an event-driven architecture, or to use both together, don&rsquo;t worry, Spring does a great job in both areas.</p>
