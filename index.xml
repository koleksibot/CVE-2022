      <description>Go is known for its &amp;ldquo;self contained battery&amp;rdquo; and many developers are fond of the feature-rich standard library that comes with Go. Among the Go standard libraries, the net/http package is one of the most popular and commonly used packages, allowing us to generate a medium-performance http server with a few lines of code that supports large concurrency. http.Client is also the most widely used http client, and its performance</description>

      <description>The Go language is said to be &amp;ldquo;battery-included&amp;rdquo;, which means that the Go standard library is available out of the box, providing Gopher with a feature-rich set of common toolkits that are sufficient for most everyday development needs. In particular, the Go Standard Library toolkit is widely used in areas where the Go language excels. The following chart shows the results of the Official Go 2020 User Survey. We see</description>

      <description>The reflection package provided by Go in the standard library gives Go programs the ability to reflect at runtime (reflection), but this reflection ability is also a &amp;ldquo;double-edged sword&amp;rdquo;, it has the advantage of solving a specific class of problems, but also brings a lack of logic, performance problems, and difficult to find problems and debug It also brings disadvantages such as unclear logic, performance problems, and difficulty in problem</description>

      <description>In the era of cloud-native and microservices-dominated architectural models, there are only two types of communication protocols used for internal service interactions: HTTP API (RESTful API) and RPC. With today&amp;rsquo;s hardware configurations and network conditions, modern RPC implementations generally perform better than HTTP API. We compare json over http with gRPC(insecure), using ghz and hey stress test the gRPC and json over http implementations. The performance of gRPC (Requests/sec: 59924.34)</description>

      <description>Most Gophers don&amp;rsquo;t really have to care about Go variable escape analysis, or can even ignore it. But if you&amp;rsquo;re using Go in a performance-sensitive domain, where you want to completely squeeze the performance out of your Go application, then understanding Go escape analysis can be very beneficial. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at understanding Go escape analysis together. 1. The problem to be solved by escape analysis</description>

When the complexity of the business reaches a certain level, they are then forced to make network adjustments and optimizations. And any major adjustments on the network will have a huge impact on the business. In the end, you will be caught in a dilemma and have to invest more manpower, carry the historical burden, and walk on the precipice again and again.</description>

      <description>Regardless of the field, building is often much more difficult than destroying. Building a building may take years, while destroying it may be a matter of seconds. At the root of this, because construction is an entropy-reducing process, there must be an input of energy from outside the system. One type of problem in creation that seems even more special is the problem of origins. How did the first life</description>

      <description>The Go language has a built-in expvar, and we can customize various metrics based on the support for basic metrics provided by expvar. But expvar only provides the lowest level of metric definition support, for some complex metric scenarios, third-party or self-implemented metrics packages are essential.
The go-metrics package is the most used metrics package in the Go domain, and it is an incomplete Go port of Coda Hale&amp;rsquo;s Metrics library, which is still very active in the Java community (I have to sigh: the Java ecosystem is really powerful).</description>

      <description>In the article &amp;ldquo;Go Classical Blocking TCP Stream Parsing in Practice&amp;rdquo;, we implemented a custom TCP stream-based parsing protocol based on Go&amp;rsquo;s classical blocking I/O model. The advantage of this one-connection-per-goroutine model is that it is simple, well-written, and well-understood, reducing the mental burden on developers. However, once the number of connections is up, the number of goroutines increases linearly. When faced with a large number of connections, this model</description>

      <description>1. Go function closures The Go language provides native support for closures. In Go, closures are function literals. The Go specification interprets closures in the following way.
 function literals are closures: they can refer to variables defined in their wrapping function. These variables are then shared between the wrapping function and the function literals, and they continue to exist as long as they can be accessed.
 Closures have a wide range of applications in Go, most often used in conjunction with the go keyword to create a new goroutine, such as the following code from the net/http package in the standard library.</description>

      <description>1. The cause of the problem With the introduction of the Go module in Go 1.11, the Go command to pull the dependent public go module is no longer a &amp;ldquo;pain point&amp;rdquo;. This is shown in the figure below.
We only need to configure a public GOPROXY service for the environment variable GOPROXY within our company/organization to easily pull all public go modules (public mods are open source mods).
However, as the number of Go users in the company increases and the number of Go projects increases, the problem of &amp;ldquo;code duplication&amp;rdquo; arises.</description>

      <description>As we all know, Go is a programming language with garbage collection (GC), so developers usually don&amp;rsquo;t need to think about memory management, which reduces the mental burden, and while the Go program is running, the GC is quietly working behind the scenes to do the &amp;ldquo;aftercare &amp;ldquo; for the developer: releasing the memory objects that can&amp;rsquo;t be reached periodically for subsequent reuse.

This is due to the fact that Go chose to abandon the header file inclusion mechanism of its C ancestor in favor of package as the basic unit of compilation, which makes dependency analysis very simple and avoids the huge overhead of analyzing dependencies through header files as in C.

      <description>1. Why Asynchronous Programming JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that can only execute one task at a time. In order to handle different task scheduling logic, asynchronous programming is unavoidable in JavaScript development. The following scenarios necessarily involve asynchronous programming methods. IO operations: external device access File access TCP / UDP network access Asynchronous APIs setTimeout / setInterval setImmediate process.nextTick queueMicrotask Event 2.

      <description>Some time ago, when doing some tests, I came across Linux tc, because I needed to add a delay to the packets, I used netem in tc. It is very easy to add a simple delay, just one command like this: $ tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 1s, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to fully understand the meaning of the parameters in the command . But when you want to do some more specific restrictions, (such as adding delay only to a specific ip port, or adding delay only to inbound traffic), things get a little tricky, and a simple Google search doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to satisfy the requirements anymore.</description>

      <description>Previously, I wrote an article on SSL protocol, which introduces the fundamentals of cryptography and gives an overall overview of the SSL protocol. For space reasons, the detailed flow of the SSL handshake was not covered in depth. In this paper, we will disassemble the handshake process and introduce it in detail at the message level. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the basic concepts of cryptography or don&amp;rsquo;t know the basic information of SSL protocol, it is recommended to read the previous article first.</description>

      <description>Vulnerability Description The vulnerability is in the BN_mod_sqrt() interface function, which is used to compute the square root of a modulus and expects that the argument p should be a prime number, but there is no check within the function, which leads to a possible infinite loop internally. This function is used when parsing certificates of the following format.
 when the certificate contains an elliptic curve public key in compressed format certificate with explicit elliptic curve parameters whose base point is encoded in compressed format  In short, this function is called when the certificate is parsed and the point coordinates need to be decompressed.</description>

      <description>I first learned about the slab algorithm when I was learning the Linux kernel. The kernel uses the Buddy System algorithm to manage memory pages. But for small objects, it would be wasteful to use a page allocator, so slab was born. The kernel&amp;rsquo;s kmalloc() is managed using slab. nginx&amp;rsquo;s shared memory management uses the same idea, but it is not as complex as slab in the Linux kernel. slab</description>

      <description>Anyone familiar with the Go language should be familiar with interfaces and methods such as io.Copy()/io.CopyN()/io.CopyBuffer()/io.ReaderFrom. They are APIs that are often used to transfer data using Go to manipulate various types of I/O. The TCP-based socket makes use of Linux&amp;rsquo;s zero-copy technologies sendfile and splice when transferring data using these interfaces and methods.
splice After looking through Linux zero-copy techniques, splice is more suitable as a general-purpose zero-copy method than other techniques such as mmap, sendfile and MSG_ZEROCOPY in terms of cost, performance and applicability.</description>

 The advantage of separating IaaS, MySQL middleware, and App tier monitoring is that the systems are highly available and fault-tolerant to each other. When the App tier monitoring does not work, the IaaS tier monitoring will immediately show up. Separation of long and short term metrics. Short-term metrics are used to provide alerting systems with high frequency queries for recent data, and long-term metrics are used to provide people with queries for data sets that span a larger period of time.</description>

      <description>1. What this article is about Growth in business volume and evolution of business forms require solid and robust IT systems to support them. Business content is transparent to the market, but IT systems can&amp;rsquo;t be built overnight. The competition between companies in the future will mainly come from the competition between IT systems, and the ability to respond quickly to business needs is the key to victory.
IT systems are constantly evolving.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/kuberentes-federation/</guid>
      <description>Kubernetes has claimed to support 5,000 nodes in a single cluster since an earlier release, and there are no plans to increase the number of nodes supported by a single Kubernetes cluster in the near future. If you need to support more than 5,000 nodes in Kubernetes, Federation is the preferred method of cluster federation.
 People frequently ask how far we are going to go in improving Kubernetes scalability. Currently we do not have plans to increase scalability beyond 5000-node clusters (within our SLOs) in the next few releases.</description>

At the same time, the development task mainly uses Yaml and Shell, which extends the scope of Tekton for various scenarios. Above is a diagram of Tekton under multiple clusters. Why does Tekton need a multi-cluster execution pipeline? Variable Kubernetes clusters at any time. A single Kubernetes cluster cannot</description>

Generally we use macros to determine the code, selectively pick the parts that need to be compiled, and turn on such conditions in the build system. 1 2 3 4</description>

      <description>In non-phased build scenarios, when using containers for builds, we can mount the cache directory in the container to the build host to perform the build task; then copy the product to the run image to make the application image. However, in a phased build, the build image and the run image are in the same Dockerfile, which makes it difficult to optimize the cache for third-party dependencies.

      <description>I recently helped a colleague troubleshoot a problem where the same message was being consumed repeatedly when using Pulsar.
Troubleshoot I was skeptical when he told me about this phenomenon, based on my previous experience with Pulsar, which is explained in the official documentation and API.
Only when the ackTimeout for consumption is set and the consumption timeout is timed out will the message be recast, which is off by default and really not on by looking at the code.</description>

There are still many areas that rely heavily on docker for local development testing or CI/CD streamline image builds. For example, docker&amp;rsquo;s official build-push-action is the preferred method for building container images on GitHub.

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s network applications have shifted from CPU-intensive to I/O-intensive, and most of the network servers are based on the C-S model, i.e., the Client-Server model, which requires a lot of network communication between the client and the server, which also determines the performance bottleneck of modern network applications: I/O. The standard I/O interface of the traditional Linux operating system is based on data copy operations, i.e. I/O operations result in</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones are carrying more and more features, and naturally users need more and more storage space. But for users with low-end phones, storage space is stretched to the limit, and they often need to uninstall apps that are already installed on their phones in order to install some new apps, thus freeing up space on their phones.
Google brought the feature of uninstalling unused apps to Android a few years ago, which prompts users to uninstall apps they haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a long time to free up space when the phone is running low.</description>

      <description>What is a CRD CRD itself is a Kubernetes built-in resource type, which stands for CustomResourceDefinition, and can be viewed with the kubectl get command to see the CRD resources defined within the cluster.

      <description>The database used by Open Hackathon is MongoDB, and in containerization, the security of data is a top priority.
Storage issues Stateful applications need to use PersistentVolume when deployed on Kubernetes, but if the underlying PV storage is unreliable, even with PV, data security is still not guaranteed.
In a general usage scenario, the application needs to define a PersistentVolumeClaim to describe the required storage resources and use the PersistentVolumeClaim in the Pod, and the cluster will create or find a PersistentVolumeClaim based on the description in the PersistentVolumeClaim.</description>

In the face of such a hot technology, we have some questions: What exactly is Service Mesh and what does it solve? In this article, we try to briefly explain the architectural design of Service Mesh and introduce its popular solution, Istio.
Starting with distributed systems Modern applications rarely use monolithic architectures anymore, and when distributed architectures become mainstream, network calls between system components become a natural problem.</description>

      <description>When participating in interviews, Linux processes should be considered a must for me, because many languages don&amp;rsquo;t bother to implement a set of process management and scheduling, but instead borrow directly from the operating system, especially the Python community which sees no need to duplicate the wheel in this area and uses a simple wrapper around system calls. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen to the concurrent code you write if you don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Linux processes.</description>

      <description>This article will explain the basic operations of concurrent programming in Python. Concurrency and parallelism are twin brothers, and the concepts are often confused. Joe Armstrong, the father of Erlang, has a very interesting diagram that illustrates these two concepts. One of my personal preferences is that concurrency is macro-parallel and micro-serial. GIL While Python comes with great class libraries to support multithreaded/processed programming, it is well known that Python</description>

      <description>A container acts as an instance of a image, a runtime for stateless applications in the images. Stateless is so-called because the lifecycle of a container is very flexible. When a container&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle ends, the data generated during that time does not persist, but is removed with the deletion of the container. However, most applications are for data now, so the persistence of containers is explored here.
Storage for containers Before we discuss container persistence, let&amp;rsquo;s explore what data storage looks like without persistence, i.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is one of the most widely used computational tools for big data analytics today. It excels at batch and real-time stream processing and supports machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data analytics applications. The narrowly defined Hadoop (MR) technology stack is shrinking as Spark becomes more popular and more heavily used. In addition, general opinion and practical experience has proven that Hadoop (YARN) does not have the flexibility to integrate with a broader enterprise technology stack, except for Big Data-related workloads.</description>

      <description>The common data collections in JavaScript are lists (Array) and mapping tables (Plain Object). This article talks about mapping tables. Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, the object itself is a mapping table, and the &amp;ldquo;attribute name ⇒ attribute value&amp;rdquo; of an object is the &amp;ldquo;key ⇒ value&amp;rdquo; in the mapping table. To make it easier to use the object as a mapping table, JavaScript even allows property names</description>

      <description>A coroutine, also known as a micro-thread, is a lightweight thread. coroutines can be understood as processes that collaborate with the caller to produce values provided by the caller. The advantage over threads is that context switching is cheaper and under the control of the user.
History of development Coroutines in Python have gone through three main phases. coroutines were first implemented in Python 2.5, morphed from generators and implemented with keywords like yield/send; yield from was introduced, allowing complex generators to be refactored into small nested generators; Python 3.</description>

Job A Job is actually one or more pods that are defined to execute a task, and when the pod exits after execution, the Job is done. So Job is also called Batch Job, i.e. compute business or offline business.

      <description>Most of the authentication mechanisms in K8s are done with ServiceAccount. Although K8s has the concept of User, there is no resource that corresponds to a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;, so it is still very difficult to do user management in K8s. The good thing is that K8s provides an alternative way for user management, which is to interface with the OIDC protocol. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what the OIDC protocol is and how it is used in K8s.</description>

      <description>Service discovery is an important feature of K8s, and there are two ways to do this: either by injecting the svc ClusterIP into the pod as an environment variable, or by using DNS, which has replaced kube dns as the built-in DNS server since version 1.13. In this article, we will briefly analyze coreDNS.

      <description>As we all know, in the K8s permission management system, you can bind RoleBinding to ServiceAccount, User and Group to achieve permission assignment.
We often use ServiceAccount to restrict the permissions of a pod; for User and Group, there are no specific resources to correspond to them except for some special system groups, which is very unfriendly to the user management in traditional projects.

AdmissionWebhooks for K8s First of all, it is important to know what AdmissionWebhooks is in K8s and what its purpose is.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the scenario. If we need to make configuration changes or checks on a pod before it is created, this part of the work would require the administrator to compile it into a binary file in ApiServer, which would be very annoying if the configuration changes were made in a custom form.</description>

      <description>This article is based on reading the source code of Kubernetes v1.16. The article has some source code, but I will try to describe it clearly by matching pictures In the Kubernetes Master node, there are three important components: ApiServer, ControllerManager, and Scheduler, which are responsible for the management of the whole cluster together. In this article, we try to sort out the workflow and principle of ControllerManager. What is</description>

      <description>This article is based on Argo v2.7.6, Kubernetes v1.18
 Argo is a workflow engine based on Kubernetes CRD implementation, providing container-native workflows for Kubernetes, i.e. each workflow node is running a task as a container.
Installation Since it is based on the Kubernetes CRD implementation, it is composed of CRD + Controller.
Installing Argo is as simple as creating an argo namespace and applying an official yaml.

      <description>The program itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to care where its data and code live, and memory appears to be contiguous and exclusive to the program. This is certainly not the case, and it is the operating system that is responsible for this - memory virtualization. This article describes how the operating system implements a virtual memory system.
Address Space The operating system provides an easy-to-use abstraction of physical memory: the address space.</description>

      <description>The previous article, Kubelet Pod Creation Workflow, explained how kubelet creates pods and how the components collaborate with each other. Based on the previous article, this article will explain how kubelet performs quality of service management for pods.
Pod QoS Kubernetes has a QoS type for each Pod, which is used to manage the quality of service for the Pod. There are three types, in decreasing order of priority.
 Guaranteed: Each container in a Pod must have a request and a limit, and the values must be the same.</description>

      <description>This article is based on reading the source code of Kubernetes v1.19.0-rc.3
 Kubelet, one of the four components of Kubernetes, maintains the entire lifecycle of a pod and is the last link in the pod creation process of Kubernetes. This article will introduce how Kubelet creates pods.
Architecture of Kubelet First look at a diagram of the Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s component architecture, as follows.
It can be seen that Kubelet is mainly divided into three layers: API layer, syncLoop layer, CRI and the following; API layer is well understood, that is, the part that provides the interface to the outside; syncLoop layer is the core working layer of Kubelet, the main work of Kubelet is centered around this syncLoop, that is, the control loop, run by producers and consumers; CRI provides the interface of container and mirror services, the container can be accessed as a CRI plugin when running.</description>

      <description>There are various network solutions for containers, and it is obviously impractical to adapt every network implementation supported, and CNI was invented to be compatible with multiple network solutions.CNI stands for Container Network Interface, which is a standard common interface to connect container management system and network plugins. In simple terms, container runtime provides network namespace for containers, network plug-in is responsible for inserting network interface into the network namespace</description>

      <description>There are more and more networking solutions for containers, and with each new solution, it is obviously unreasonable to adapt the networking solution to different container runtimes, and CNI is designed to solve this problem.
While maintaining a &amp;ldquo;home-level Kubernetes cluster&amp;rdquo; at home during holidays, I got the idea to write a network plugin, and developed Village Net based on cni/plugin.
Taking this network plugin as an example, this article focuses on how to implement a CNI plugin.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been doing CSI-related work, and as I have been developing it, I have come to believe that the details of CSI are quite tedious. By organizing the CSI workflow, I can deepen my understanding of CSI and share my knowledge of CSI with you.
I will introduce CSI through two articles, the first of which will focus on the basic components and workings of CSI, based on Kubernetes as the COs (Container Orchestration Systems) for CSI.</description>

      <description>This article is based on reading the source code of Kubernetes v1.22.1
 Kubelet allows nodes to be evicted if they are under-resourced. I have recently studied Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction mechanism and found a lot to learn from it, so I&amp;rsquo;ll share it with you.
Kubelet Configuration Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s eviction feature needs to be turned on in the configuration, and the threshold value for eviction needs to be configured.

      <description>There are three principles of Rust Ownership to keep in mind.
 For each value, there is an owner. There can only be one owner for a value at a time. When the owner leaves the scope, the corresponding value is automatically dropped.  hello is a string allocated on the heap, and the owner is s, which, when passed as an argument to the function takes_ownership, moves ownership to some_string .</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/rust-ownership-three-princples/</guid>
      <description>The core concept of Rust is Ownership, a GC-enabled language that allows the runtime to sweep the heap at runtime and release unreferenced garbage objects, such as go. For languages like c/c++, you need to manage the allocation and release of memory yourself. Rust uses the concept of Ownership and appends various check rules to the compiler to implement memory management. Note that most of Rust&amp;rsquo;s work is done at</description>

      <title>How to troubleshoot problems with systemtap</title>

      <description>What is systemtap We generally debug our programs, and the logs printed by the business process are basically sufficient for our needs. If not, using strace, lsof, or perf is enough to see the bottleneck of performance. But for system programming, you can&amp;rsquo;t print logs like crazy, and many call stacks are in kernel space, so ordinary debugging means are stretched to the limit.
At this point systemtap comes in handy, it adds probe probes to kernel functions, aggregates statistics on kernel space function calls, and even intervenes in them.</description>

      <description>Rust has a reputation for having a steep learning curve and a rigorous and secure language. But recently, while studying The Book, I discovered that it allows variable shadowing .
If the ordinary shadowing is not enough, the same lexical scope allows different types of variables, using the same variable name .
What else can I say but shock? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the case of rust, go.

Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; allocates space on the heap, stores the T value, and returns the corresponding pointer. Also Box implements trait Deref dereference and Drop destructor to automatically free space when Box leaves the scope.

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/rust-why-need-interior-mutability/</guid>
      <description>This article refers to rust book ch15 and adds its own understanding, interested parties can first look at the official documentation.
Rust has two ways to achieve mutability
 Inheritance variability: for example, if a struct is declared with let mut, then any field of the struct can be modified later. Internal mutability: use Cell RefCell to wrap a variable or field so that it can be modified even if the external variable is read-only  It seems that inheritance mutability is enough, so why do we need the so-called interior mutability internal mutability?</description>

      <description>There is no such thing as x32. x86 and x64 refer to the instruction set architecture of the CPU.
Instruction set The instruction set can be understood as the hardware&amp;rsquo;s interface to the outside world. We run programs through the operating system scheduling, and the operating system then allows the hardware to compute.
If you let the hardware compute, such as some addition and multiplication, loops and so on, you need the interface provided by the hardware, that is, the instruction set.</description>

      <description>I. The execution process of useEffect and useLayoutEffect The first thing to note is that useLayoutEffect and useEffect are very similar and have the same function signature. The only difference is that useEffect is executed asynchronously, while useLayoutEffect is executed synchronously. When the function component is refreshed (rendered), the whole process of the component containing the useEffect runs as follows. component re-rendering is triggered (by changing the component state or</description>

      <description>A new cgroups vulnerability, codenamed CVE-2022-0492, which could be abused to evade containers in order to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.
The vulnerability comes from a Linux kernel feature known as cgroups control group, cgroups allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups so that CPU, memory, and other resource usage, disk I/O, and networking can be limited and monitored.
However, because cgroups lacks internal validation of the release_agent file and fails to properly check whether the process setting the release_agent file has administrative privileges, an attacker can use this cgroups v1 release_agent feature to elevate privileges and accidentally bypass namespace isolation.</description>

      <description>The project uses argo-workflow as the workflow engine to orchestrate and run some hyperconverged cluster deployment related tasks, and the whole environment runs on a single node K3s. The main reason for choosing argo-workflow + K3s is to consume as few system resources as possible, since this environment will run on various laptops with different hardware configurations in the future 😂. After researching some common K8s deployment tools, we finally chose K3s, which consumes less system resources.</description>

      <description>Someone mentioned a problem before, it is about Prometheus monitoring Job task false alarm problem, the general meaning of the CronJob control Job, the front of the execution failed, monitoring will trigger the alarm, after the solution to generate a new Job can be executed normally, but will still receive the alarm in front.
This is because we generally keep some history when executing Job tasks to facilitate troubleshooting, so if there is a failed Job before, even if it will become successful later, the previous Job will continue to exist, and the default alarm rule used by most direct kube-prometheus installation and deployment is kube_job_ status_failed &amp;gt; 0, which is obviously inaccurate.</description>

      <description>DNS systems use plaintext UDP protocol to communicate by default, so the content of users&#39; queries can be easily monitored, and the resolution results returned by servers can be easily tampered with. To solve this problem, technologies such as DNS over HTTPS/TLS/QUIC have been introduced in the hope of transmitting DNS queries in an encrypted manner. However, with the use of public DoH recursive resolution servers, authoritative DNS servers can only get the address of the recursive resolution server, but not the user&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

The reason is that the two routes have the same HTTP method (meaning GET/POST/PUT/DELETE, etc.) and request path prefix, and in the same route location, the first route is a wildcard (meaning :id of this form) parameter, and the second route is a normal string info, then a route conflict occurs.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/ieee754/</guid>
      <description>Years ago when I was studying C++ at university, I learned that IEEE 754 is the most common way of representing floating point numbers in computers today. But since I work with it very little, I often forget the specific details of this standard, so I wrote this article to document it in detail.
How do you represent numbers? There are many ways to represent numbers. For example, the most common way we use when writing - fixing the position of the decimal point, placing a decimal point in the middle of several numbers to represent a decimal, or a whole number if there is no decimal point.</description>

Preview Link: https://codepen.io/Chokcoco/pen/BamYMYg
It is implemented with the JS animation library GSAP. Take a look.
I wondered if I could use CSS to achieve the same effect. After trying it out, I managed to achieve the original effect using pure CSS.
The core of the above effect is the animation of the text, which changes from thinner and tighter to thicker and farther apart.</description>

      <description>Merging is a very common operation in Git: you can merge changes between branches, or perform pull and push operations on remote branches.
However, the git merge command can be a bit daunting for newcomers, because you can get different results from running merge in different situations. This uncertainty about the results has kept me from actively using it for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve relied on visual interfaces like GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Pull Request or GitLab&amp;rsquo;s Merge Request to merge manually.</description>

Exclude lines that do not match To print only the lines that do not match the search pattern, use the -v (or -invert-match) option.</description>

      <description>The Go language community is discussing a new proposal called &amp;ldquo;arena&amp;rdquo;.
According to the proposal, &amp;ldquo;Go arena&amp;rdquo; is used to optimize memory allocation. arena is a method of allocating a set of memory objects from contiguous memory regions, with the advantage that allocating objects from arena is generally more efficient than general memory allocation. More importantly, objects in arena can be released all at once with minimal memory management or garbage collection overhead.</description>

      <description>With the increasing use of third-party libraries in software, we often encounter the problem of global namespaces being polluted, leading to name conflicts between components in the global namespace. As a result, we need to use namespaces to organize blocks of code in order to uniquely identify variables, objects, and classes.
In this article, we will discuss namespaces, when they are needed, and how they can be used to enhance the organization of TypeScript code.</description>

      <description>The original JavaScript environment lacked a static type system and had little support for containerized dependency injection, making the code I wrote prone to obvious errors and nearly impossible to test.
TypeScript&amp;rsquo;s compile-time type system changes all that, allowing continuous development of complex projects. It has brought back design patterns such as dependency injection, proper typing and passing of dependencies during object construction, which promotes more structured programming and helps write tests without the need for patching.</description>

      <description>In early 2008, Australian brothers Simon Zerner and Toby Zerner started the development of esoTalk. Unfortunately, esoTalk was still in Alpha phase when the lead developer brother Simon passed away in mid-2009.
It was his brother Toby who replaced Simon in maintaining and updating esoTalk.
In the README.md file, it says: &amp;ldquo;esoTalk was developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother Simon.&amp;rdquo; In the end, the two brothers left behind an open source forum system developed with PHP+MySQL, with very simple, fast and modern features.</description>

      <description>The Image Widget in Flutter has built-in support for files in the form of file, network, and memory. However, these only support regular compressed image files or binary data, such as jpg, png, webp files, etc. There is no support for raw rgba binary data. Raw binary data here refers to the array of bytes consisting of the color values of each pixel of an image. A picture has width x height pixel points, the color value of a pixel point is stored with 32bit, divided into 4 channels, each channel occupies 8bit, respectively, red, green, blue, transparency (RGBA), this array is the collection of color values of each pixel point, dart in general use Uint8List.</description>

      <description>Memcached is the oldest in-memory caching server. Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support as rich a data structure as Redis, Memcached is used less and less. But I think Memcached is a great example of the Unix philosophy of doing one thing at a time and doing it well. And Memcached is focused on the one thing that is memory caching. This is best demonstrated by the introduction of Meta Commands in Memcached in version 1.</description>

While the Linux kernel is evolving rapidly, it also relies on some very old tools, one of which is that the kernel code is still using the 1989 version of the C language standard - a standard that was written more than 30 years ago before the kernel project was started.</description>

In short, a process is a program instance. It can be foreground (interactive process) or background (non-interactive or automatic process). It can be a parent process (the creator of other processes at runtime) or a child process (a process created by other processes).
In Linux, every process has a parent process, except for the first init (or systemd) process with a PID of 0.</description>

In this article, AWS compares Rust and Go as examples. AWS believes the reason for this is that Go is a garbage collection (GC) language, so when objects are created and released, the garbage collector needs to stop the program every once in a while and run a garbage collection. When the garbage collector is running, the process cannot respond to requests.</description>

      <description>We know that using Linux swap space instead of RAM (memory) can seriously degrade performance. So, one might ask, since I have enough available memory, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to remove the swap space? The short answer is no. Enabling swap space brings performance benefits, even if you have more than enough RAM.
Even with enough server memory installed, you will often find that you will use swap space after a long period of normal operation.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s technological age, we have witnessed a huge leap in the use of Internet and networked devices. Every home has a laptop, smartphone, digital watch, IoT devices, home automation components and other devices connected to the home network or the Internet. Devices communicate with each other over a variety of network protocols, of which TCP and IP are the most commonly used. Each device connected to the network must have an IP address that identifies the device on the network.</description>

      <description>The StateOfJS 2021 State of JavaScript Survey reports that JavaScript is in a much better state than it was in 2016. When the first State of JS survey was conducted, TypeScript usage was only 21%; today it is 69%. This is followed by Elm at 2.4 percent, Flow at 1.7 percent, and CoffeeScript at 1.4 percent.
The report was actually delayed to 2022 due to the large number of matters in 2021.</description>

      <description>Greg Brockman, CTO of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company, today posted a tweet about &amp;ldquo;error messages&amp;rdquo; in programming, saying that one of the most underappreciated skills in programming is writing friendly error messages. Greg believes that a good error message should be self-explanatory and have three main points:
 what the user did. what acceptable inputs are. how to fix the problem.  Musk also commented on his opinion in this tweet, which he fully agrees with, and also said that compilers for programming languages could be better because not enough is currently being invested in them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-02/force-delete-k8s-terminating-namespace/</guid>
      <description>When deleting a namespace, the delete operation is interrupted when it is not completely deleted, and the namespace is in the terminating state. One solution is to delete again with the --force option after the command, e.g.
1  kubectl delete ns &amp;lt;terminating-namespace&amp;gt; --force   But it often doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, so you need to use the interface to delete the namespace.
First, export the namespace information for the terminating state to a json file.</description>

      <description>Sigstore is the latest project of Linux Foundation, which is a new model of software signature based on Certificate Transparency Log.
Sigstore solves the problem of keeping private keys caused by traditional PGP signatures, it has excellent openness and scalability, and is known as the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt of software signatures.
TL;DR Briefly, what the Sigstore project implements is to record the information of each signature through the Certificate Transparency Log, and end users query the Log and verify it when they need to use it.</description>

      <description>We usually use document.cookie for operations such as adding, deleting, and checking cookies. Here we introduce a new method cookieStore. 1. How to manipulate cookies in general document.cookie gets all the cookie strings for the current domain. Each cookie is separated by a semicolon. 1 document.cookie; // &amp;#34;a=1; b=2; c=wenzi&amp;#34; To manipulate cookies, you are generally manipulating document.cookie.

      <description>Proxy is a syntax added to the es2015 standard specification, and it is likely that you have only heard of it but not used it - after all, Proxy features cannot be used easily given the compatibility issues. But now, with each browser&amp;rsquo;s update iteration, Proxy&amp;rsquo;s support is getting higher and higher. Vue3 has replaced Object.defineProperty with Proxy for responsiveness, and mobx has been using Proxy for proxying since version</description>

      <description>Nine years after the release of TLS 1.2, and four long years of agreement on it, TLS 1.3 is now available, designed with the simple goal of making data transfers faster and more secure.
More secure TLS uses a hybrid encryption process, which means that symmetric encryption is used during communication and the key for that encryption is negotiated through asymmetric encryption. The MAC algorithm is used for integrity checking and the certificate system is used for authentication.</description>

      <description>Although TLS can encrypt the entire communication process, there are still many privacy-sensitive parameters that have to be transmitted in plaintext during the negotiation process, the most important and problematic of which is the domain name to be accessed, i.e. SNI (Server Name Indication). There is also the ALPN extension used to inform the client of the available application layer protocols, and compromising this could lead to an attacker knowing the services supported by the server and the purpose of the connection.</description>

TLS (Transport Layer Security), formerly known as SSL (Secure Socket Layer), is located between TCP and the application layer. Compared to HTTP, HTTPS does not change the protocol itself, but adds a layer of TLS between TCP and HTTP for encryption to ensure information security.

However, hard disks are several orders of magnitude slower than memory in terms of IO reads and writes, so why would you prefer hard disks?
The first thing that needs to be mentioned is that the main reason why operating a disk is slow is because of the time consuming read and write to the disk.</description>

      <description>We usually use domain names, such as taoshu.in, to access the Internet. But computers need to use IP addresses when they communicate. The core function of DNS is to save the mapping between domain names and IP addresses. Today, we will introduce how DNS works.
In DNS, the core concept is the domain name. A domain name is a way of organizing information hierarchically, somewhat similar to a computer&amp;rsquo;s folders. Take a Windws system for example, the path where user Demo&amp;rsquo;s desktop is located is C:\Users\Demo\Desktop.</description>

When I communicate and discuss with these companies, including implementation and program comparison, there are a lot of comparisons and compromises of various programs. Today, I would like to write this article to summarize my personal experience and ideas in the hope that more people can refer to and learn from them, and be able to make a better architecture.</description>

      <description>Flow line work models are common in industry, dividing the workflow into multiple segments, each with the right number of personnel depending on the intensity of the work. A good assembly line design tries to balance the flow rate of each step to maximize productivity.
Go is a practical language, and the pipeline work model is very well integrated with Go.
pipeline A pipeline consists of multiple links, specifically in Go, where the links communicate with each other via channels and the same link task can be processed by multiple goroutines at the same time.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s new Chrome OS Flex is a chance to rejuvenate these old devices.
Chrome OS Flex is a new system from Google that differs from regular Chrome OS in that you can install it on devices that were originally based on Windows or macOS (not ARM chips), turning them into Chromebooks.</description>

      <description>Recently, while reading Go1.18 Release Notes, I found that the Title method of the strings, bytes standard library has been deprecated. Why is this?
Introduction Here is an example of the strings standard library. The strings.Title method does the following: maps all Unicode letters at the beginning of a word to its Unicode title case.
The example is as follows.

      <description>Lisp is a computer programming language invented by John McCarthy in 1958. The name &amp;ldquo;Lisp&amp;rdquo; is an abbreviation for &amp;ldquo;List Processing&amp;rdquo;, which means table processing&amp;hellip; The above is probably the accepted authoritative introduction, and a lot of information on the Internet probably says so.

This new feature is a collaboration between Opera and Yat, a startup that sells emoji URLs, and through Yat users can make a one-time purchase and receive a unique domain name made up of emojis.</description>

 Usually we use #include to include header files, as follows.

 The number of Extender extensions is limited: only &amp;ldquo;Filter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Prioritize&amp;rdquo; extensions are available during scheduling. The &amp;ldquo;Preempt&amp;rdquo; extension is called after running the default preemption mechanism. &amp;ldquo;Extender cannot be called at other points, e.g. not before running the predicate function. Performance issues: Each call to an extender involves JSON coding and decoding.</description>

      <description>Today, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about an interesting question: Unplug the cable for a few seconds, then plug it back in, does the original TCP connection still exist?
Some people may say that if the cable is unplugged, it means the physical layer is disconnected, so the upper transport layer should also be disconnected, so the original TCP connection will not exist. Just like when we make a wired phone call, if one party&amp;rsquo;s phone line is unplugged, the call is completely disconnected.</description>

      <description>Background C/C++ client needs to receive and send JSON format data to the backend to achieve communication and data interaction, but there is no ready-made interface for handling JSON format data in C++, so we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid splitting and splicing by directly referring to third-party libraries. Considering that there will be a lot of JSON data to be processed in this project, we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid the repetitive splitting and splicing.</description>

After the Buffer (meaning video memory) of the three graphics APIs (D3D12, Vulkan, Metal) is mapped, the CPU will be able to access it, and at this point, note that the GPU can still access this piece of video memory.

      <description>How to implement a thread pool Thread pooling: a thread usage pattern. Too many threads introduce scheduling overhead, which in turn affects cache locality and overall performance. Instead, a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for a supervising manager to assign tasks that can be executed concurrently. This avoids the cost of creating and destroying threads while processing short time tasks. Thread pools not only ensure full utilization of the</description>

The main options In NodeJS, there are two main options for communicating with code written in other languages.
 Using the AddOn technique, write an extension to NodeJS using C++ and then call the source code or dynamic libraries written in other languages in the code using the FFI (Foreign Function Interface) technique, which brings in dynamic libraries written in other languages directly in Node  A comparison of these two approaches shows that each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</description>

Although this is a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; logo for Chrome in 8 years, you can see that the changes are not too drastic. Even at first glance, you can hardly tell what has changed.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some of the design details and see what&amp;rsquo;s different between the new version and the old one.</description>

      <description>MariaDB, an open source database company said, plans to become a public company with the help of Angel Pond Inc.
Based in Helsinki, Finland, MariaDB originally emerged as an offshoot of MySQL. This was because the founders of the MySQL project had concerns about its independence after Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008.
MariaDB&amp;rsquo;s CTO was Michael Widenius, one of the founders of MySQL, and MariaDB was named after Widenius&#39; youngest daughter.</description>

Specifically, they are developing a new API that will allow games to communicate their current state to the OS. If the game takes time to load, the OS will send a command; the CPU will then run at a higher frequency, thus reducing the game load time.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Golang&amp;rsquo;s not addressable concept, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, it literally means that you can&amp;rsquo;t get the address of a value. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { m := map[int]string{0: &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34;} fmt.Printf(&amp;#34;%p&amp;#34;, &amp;amp;m[0]) }   m is of type map[int]string and contains only one key-value pair.

      <description>Developers often need to track performance bottlenecks in applications in production environments and try to identify the root cause of the bottlenecks. To do this, they typically gather this information through logs. Unfortunately, this approach can be time-consuming and does not provide sufficiently detailed information about the underlying problem.
A modern and more advanced approach is to apply and use profiling techniques and tools that highlight the slowest application code and methods that consume most of the resources (such as CPU and memory).</description>

      <description>Introduction Atomic means that an operation is uninterruptible. Even when multiple threads are executing together, once an operation is started, it is not interrupted by other threads. So: atomic classes are classes that have the characteristics of atomic/atomic operations. The atomic classes of the concurrency package JUC(java.util.concurrent) are all in java.util.concurrent.atomic. Example Run the following code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14</description>

      <description>Introduction The Go language&amp;rsquo;s memory allocator takes its cue from TCMalloc&amp;rsquo;s design for high-speed memory allocation. The core idea is to use a multi-level cache to sort objects by size and implement different allocation strategies by class. Information about TCMalloc can be found here: http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html. If the object to be allocated is a small object (&amp;lt;= 32k), there is a lock-free cache of small objects in each thread that can</description>

      <description>The Go source code directory structure and corresponding code files provide an insight into Go&amp;rsquo;s implementation of network I/O modes on different platforms. For example, it is based on epoll on Linux, kqueue on freeBSD, and iocp on Windows. Since our code is deployed on Linux, this article uses the epoll wrapper implementation as an example to explain the source code implementation of I/O multiplexing in Go.

      <description>Overview When we think of &amp;ldquo;scheduling&amp;rdquo;, the first thing that comes to mind is the scheduling of processes and threads by the operating system. The operating system scheduler schedules multiple threads on the system to run on the physical CPU according to a certain algorithm. Although threads are relatively lightweight, they do have a large additional overhead when scheduling. Each thread takes up more than 1M of memory space, and</description>

      <description>Introduction Prior to 1.14 of Go, preemptive scheduling was collaborative and required self-initiated ceding of execution, but this could not handle edge cases that could not be preempted. Some of these problems were not solved until 1.14 by signal-based preemptive scheduling, such as for loops or garbage collection of long-running threads. Here is an example to verify the difference in preemption between 1.14 and 1.13. 1 2 3 4 5</description>

Daniel explains the reasons for adding native JSON support to cURL:
 sending JSON is a common practice in areas such as REST APIs &amp;ldquo;Ease of use with JSON&amp;rdquo; was a common consideration when many people were asked about choosing a cURL alternative on sites like Stack Overflow, a significant number of people were unable to send the correct JSON and quote JSON correctly using cURL because JSON uses double quotes and the Shell does not expand variables inside single quotes  Daniel also said that since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t send JSON very often, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate to rely entirely on him to design this feature.</description>

      <description>Since golang does not have a uniform coding pattern like java, we, like the rest of the team, used some of the theory presented in the article Go Package Oriented Design and Architecture Layering and then combined it with our previous project experience to define the packge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ├── cmd/</description>

      <description>Today I would like to introduce the C++ threaded high-level APIs: std::promise, std::future, std::packaged_task and std::async. The content of this article can be condensed into the following diagram.
where std::promise and std::future are synchronisation channels between threads. The std::packed_task class template is an adapter for a function or a function object. It wraps the return value of a function in std::future, allowing us to easily execute any function with std::thread. The std::async function is equivalent to the sum of std::packaged_task and std::thread.</description>

      <description>This article provides an easy and quick introduction to the principles and implementation of the CFS scheduler, a fully fair class scheduling class in the Linux kernel.
Principle The core principle of the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) is simple: each process is given as &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; a runtime as possible. So the process that has run the least in the past is chosen to run each time. Of course, as a scheduler, it has to meet much more than that, and a number of features such as Linux&amp;rsquo;s preemptive processes and support for priorities in the Completely Fair class fair_sched_class make the design of CFS much more complex than simply picking the least amount of runtime.</description>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, the HPA API came to a stable version autoscaling/v2:
 Scaling based on custom metrics Scaling based on multiple metrics Configurable scaling behaviour  From the initial v1 version of HPA, which only supported CPU and memory utilisation scaling, to the later support for custom metrics and aggregation layer APIs, to v1.</description>

      <description>Previously, Yu Zhao from Google submitted a Patch to the Linux kernel that modified the page swap algorithm in the kernel memory management module, proposing a multi-level LRU. This article takes you through the advantages of the page swap algorithm and multi-level LRU.
What are pages and page replacement We know that memory paging mechanisms are used on almost all modern operating systems and processors. In some embedded operating systems and in special cases where processor resources are tight and there is no need to consider inter-process safety, or even the concept of threads, memory paging is not necessary.</description>

      <description>Earlier in 2021, Python author Guido van Rossum was rehired by Microsoft to continue work on CPython, and they have proposed a faster-cpython project to improve the performance of CPython by a factor of 5 over 4 years. The whole project is open on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s faster-cpython group, and some of the ideas have been implemented and verified through Activity.
In this article, we will read and analyse the source code of one of the project&amp;rsquo;s key proposals, PEP 659, and learn how to optimise virtual machine performance at the bytecode level.</description>

      <description>As we all know, browsers generally have a default search engine and a number of other search engines built in that you can replace, or add manually if none of the built-in ones meet your needs. If for some reason users do not want these search engines in their browser, they can remove them from the settings.
However, in a recent update to Chromium 97, Chromium has changed these settings and the option to &amp;lsquo;remove&amp;rsquo; these default search engines no longer exists.</description>

      <description>A week after the authors of Faker.js vandalised their own open source projects, Faker.js and colors.js, Faker.js is now controlled by the community. The project is currently managed by a team of eight engineers from a variety of backgrounds and companies.
Faker.js is a very popular Node.js tool library that provides various types of mock data for development debugging. The earliest Faker project was first implemented in 2004 by Jason Kohles using Perl.</description>

      <description>Background We usually encounter a lot of file system anomalies after a system crash. We usually fix them with the fsck tool, today we will learn what fsck does and how it does it.
Workload example Suppose there is a workload that appends a single block of data to an existing file. The append is done by opening the file, calling lseek() to move the file offset to the end of the file, and then issuing a single 4KB write to the file before closing it.</description>

      <description>The need for cross-tab communication is common in scenarios where there is a lot of content to browse or manipulate (e.g. blogs or CMS systems) and data consistency needs to be maintained. Most of these scenarios can be solved by bringing in a back-end service to keep the data consistent across multiple tabs by polling and so on. This article describes a pure front-end solution for cross-tab communication without introducing</description>

      <description>useCallback takes a callback function and an array of dependencies as arguments, and returns the cached callback function if each item in the dependency array remains the same.
Since useCallback can cache functions, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t all functions in the Function component be wrapped in useCallback for the purpose of React application optimization? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at two examples and decide which one is better, App1 or App2?

      <description>Javascript&amp;rsquo;s base type (POD) and JSON actually have only one numeric type: Number. Number is usually represented by the 64-bit floating-point standard in IEEE-754 in mainstream browser implementations (i.e., double-precision floating-point), which represents valid numbers in the range \(-(2^{53} - 1)\) ~ \(2^{53} - 1\) . While 64-bit data types are often used in Go language, e.g., int64/uint64, such values are not safe to use in Javascript.
If you look at the JSON specification document, there is no limit to the number of bits, and any large value can be placed in JSON.</description>

 when directly cuRL, always the full content is displayed and the connection does not break, because it is a streaming interface, which is exactly the expected behavior. And when cURL | ... or cURL &amp;gt; file, the full content is never available, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work no matter how long you wait.  Why is this?</description>

      <title>Some minor issues with LIKE fuzzy lookups in MySQL</title>

      <description>Today, a colleague found a bug in MySQL regarding fuzzy lookups, which is quite embarrassing to say the least. When I saw the problem, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what I had written wrong.
The problem was that I meant to find rows in the database starting with abc_, but I ended up with a statement that looked like the following
1  SELECT*FROMusers_tabWHEREnameLIKE&amp;#39;abc_%&amp;#39;;  Can you find the desired results this way?</description>

It maps structured data into a database table and provides HQL (Hive SQL) queries. The underlying data is stored on HDFS, and Hive essentially converts SQL statements into MapReduce tasks to run, making it easy for users unfamiliar with MapReduce to process and compute structured data on HDFS using HQL, suitable for offline</description>

Their perceptions and evaluations have been reversed many times, and they have their own fans, creating a love-hate relationship that continues to this day, and the</description>

Whether we initialise a timer with NewTimer, timer.After, or timer.AfterFun, the timer is eventually added to a global timer heap, which is managed by Go runtime. The global timer heap has also undergone three major upgrades. Before Go 1.9, all timers were maintained by a globally</description>

      <description>1. Background In existing network environments, some businesses using Redis clusters often need to expand their node capacity as business volume increases. I have previously learnt that some of my operations and maintenance colleagues have experienced a decrease in performance after scaling a Redis cluster with a relatively large number of nodes, as evidenced by a significant increase in access latency.

      <description>Memory cgroup leaks are a common problem in K8s (Kubernetes) clusters, resulting in nodes being stretched for memory resources, or nodes becoming unresponsive and having to restart the server to recover. Most developers use regular drop cache or disable kernel kmem accounting to circumvent this problem. This paper analyses the root cause of memory cgroup leaks and provides a solution to fix the problem at the kernel level, based on a practical example from the NetEase Digital Sail kernel team.</description>

      <description>Most implementations of coroutines are based on some kind of runtime yield primitive. However, kotlin does not have this kind of lower-level support, and still implements coroutines based on CPS transformations on jvm, which does not have yield instruction support.

      <description>Uber recently posted an article that focuses on dynamically tuning GOGC on core services to reduce the mark phase CPU usage of GC. Basically, it is effective, low-risk, scalable and semi-automated.
Uber&amp;rsquo;s current service scale is about a few thousand microservices, based on the scheduling infrastructure on the cloud for deployment. Most of the services are written by GO, and the author of this article is doing Maps Production Engineering, a group that has helped some Java systems to adjust GC parameters before (this should be the starting point for them to help Go to do optimization and think about how to adjust parameters).</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I was working with a colleague to troubleshoot a problem with a VM IP change, so I just wanted to organize the DHCP lease life cycle and the change process.
DHCP lease lifecycle  Allocation: A client starts with no valid lease, and therefore no DHCP-assigned address. It acquires a lease through an allocation process. Reallocation: If a client already has an address from an existing lease, then when it reboots or starts up after shutdown, it contacts the DHCP server that granted it the lease to confirm the lease and obtain operational parameters.</description>

      <description>As any developer familiar with Python knows, Python has default parameters that allow us to optionally override certain default parameters as needed when instantiating an object to determine how to instantiate the object. This feature is great for elegantly simplifying code when an object has multiple default arguments.
The Go language does not syntactically support default parameters, so in order to create objects both by default parameters and by passing custom parameters, we need to use some programming tricks to achieve this.</description>

      <description>The C language is highly efficient, flexible, feature-rich and portable, and is highly sought after in programming, especially in system software development. Its efficient flexibility is largely due to its ability to provide low-end control over memory by pointing to it, but at the cost of programmers having to handle memory access details with extra care to avoid operational errors such as memory leaks and buffer overflows.
 Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed.</description>

As hard drive prices continue to drop, NAS devices have made their way into the homes of the masses. Leading SMB and home NAS market brands such as Synology range in price from $300 on the low end to $700 on the high end. But if you are a Raspberry Pi player, you can build a very good home NAS and streaming service at about half the cost of the lowest price.</description>

      <description>IPv6 supports multiple addresses, making address assignment more flexible and convenient. Unlike IPv4, which relied solely on the DHCP protocol for address assignment, IPv6 incorporates a native stateless address autoconfiguration (Sateless Address Autoconfiguration, abbreviated SLAAC) protocol. SLAAC can either work alone to provide IPv6 addresses to hosts, or it can work with DHCPv6 to generate new assignment schemes. Here is a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic address allocation mechanism for IPv6.</description>

TCP and UDP datagram headers also use the same checksum algorithm, but the data involved in the operation is different from the IP header. In addition, IPv6&amp;rsquo;s operation of checksums is slightly different from IPv4. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze</description>

      <description>You may see the title and wonder: why do this? react hooks is a useful invention that reorganizes the paradigm of writing and thinking about code, using smaller abstractions to split state and functions by function rather than centralizing them into a single state or lifecycle. But react hooks suffers from the notion of state dependencies, and worse: it relies on manual management - despite the official eslint rules provided</description>

      <description>FAT file system knowledge overview A file is, in fact, data. Data is represented in the computer as 0/1, and the most basic unit is the bit. 8 bit = 1 Byte, 1024 Byte = 1 KB, 1024 KB = 1 MB, and so on. The content of a file is also a combination of several 01 strings. When reading/writing a file, we call the functions read()/write() in the kernel,</description>

      <description>io_uring in a nutshell There are two important operations for asynchronous requests for io_uring: committing the request, and completing the submitted request. For IO event submission, the application is the producer and the kernel is the consumer, while for completion events, the kernel is the producer and the application is the consumer. Therefore, we need a pair of rings to provide a high-performance channel for communication between the kernel and</description>

      <description>KPTI in a Nutshell The KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) mechanism was originally designed to mitigate KASLR bypass and CPU-side channel attacks.
In the KPTI mechanism, the isolation of memory in kernel state space from user state space has been further enhanced.
 The page table in the kernel state includes the page table of user-space memory and the page table of kernel-space memory. The page table in the user state includes only the page table of user space memory and the page table of kernel space memory as necessary, such as the memory used for handling system calls, interrupts, and other information.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s put the conclusion first: kill command will only kill the target process, while bash shortcut will kill the whole foreground process group!
linux process killing methods Regardless of the method used, killing processes is done by sending a signal. The kill command actually sends a signal to the target pid process.</description>

      <description>In the process of writing code, sometimes we need to do some bulk queries/operations, which often involve chunking a large array or slice.
For example, if we have an array of ids and we want to request an interface to query information based on the ids, the interface supports batch queries, but the maximum number of queries per query is 100. the best practice is to take up to 100 ids from the array each time and do a batch query until the array is traversed.</description>

I tried it and the speed is only 5M or so. It took almost an hour to finish copying, which was unbearable. So I looked into how to speed up the transfer speed.
So why is it slow? The main reason is that ssh encrypts 🔐 the communication content, the sender has to encrypt and the receiver has to decrypt.</description>

      <description>It is well known that Go&amp;rsquo;s map is not a concurrency-safe data structure. If more than one goroutine reads and writes the same map, an error is reported. I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to say that I always thought this error could be caught with recover. Until yesterday, a colleague raised this question and sent me a demo code. Today, I took the time to study the knowledge, organize it and share it with you.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to convert a large section of text into a picture. After checking the web, I found the project hqbobo/text2pic and found that it adds a box to each character when rendering the Song-like font. So I simply researched how to render text in Go. Finally developed the txtimg widget. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share the relevant experience in summary. The body of the code is taken from the official</description>

      <description>Recently, a friend asked how to copy the contents of vim on the server to the local clipboard without using the mouse. To be honest, I always select and copy directly with the mouse. But since my friend asked, I had to do some research. I really found a solution that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the mouse. This method can not only copy the contents of vim to the local clipboard, but also to the local tmux clipboard, very convenient.</description>

Rob&amp;rsquo;s move was both unexpected and justified. Rob&amp;rsquo;s rationale was twofold: the scope of the change was too large, and the lack of real-world experience. So Rob suggested not to change the standard library in Go 1.18, but to provide a generic version of the</description>

      <description>Vim provides a macro recording feature that allows you to record a series of actions and then repeat them. This feature is relatively cold, but also very powerful. Just because the operation is complicated, few people learn and rarely use. But I think the idea of macros is very simple, the reason why I think it is complex is not particularly good real-world cases to reflect its value. I came across a more suitable scenario for the use of macros when I was modifying the Sniper framework today.</description>

      <description>The http service of the website is developed in Go. Because it listens to the standard ports 80 and 443, the http service is always run under the root account. But running with root is very risky. If the code is vulnerable and the bad guys break it, they will get root access and the consequences will be unthinkable. That&amp;rsquo;s why http services like nginx support setting the account under which the worker processes run.</description>

While sorting out the file-related plugins, I found myself using the ack plugin. ack itself has no file search capability; it uses tools like ack/ag to search for articles. The plugin itself only serves the purpose of calling commands and displaying results. Since it is relatively simple, why not implement one yourself?</description>

      <description>Slicing Operations Functions like Map/Reduce/Filter are often used in functional programming. Because of generics, we can also write Map/Reduce/Filter functions that can be adapted to any type 😂.
All three of these functions are used to process sliced data, so Go officially wanted to provide a standard slices package. But it&amp;rsquo;s subject to Rob&amp;rsquo;s objection, so it has to go under exp package underneath.

      <description>Linux provides a series of system calls that allow us to pass file descriptors between processes. Instead of simply passing the file descriptor, which is a 32-bit integer, we actually pass the file handle to the target process so that it can read and write to the file. Now suppose process B wants to send a file descriptor to process A. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to do that.

Such a system has high availability, so that the whole service will not be unavailable due to the downtime of one or two machines.</description>

So how to meet the needs of the general public to build a website? Cloudflare is a very good choice. Cloudflare is a CDN provider, can provide reverse proxy for the site. It does this by resolving the domain name to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s server (or proxy), and then the browser uses Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s certificate to establish an SSL connection with the proxy; then the proxy will establish an SSL connection with the target server using a self-signed certificate, and the next data are forwarded by the proxy.</description>

When I was first introduced to LPeg, I thought it was just another form of regular expression; I found out that it is much more powerful than regular expressions, and can easily match complex patterns that are difficult to match with regular expressions, and even parse syntax. In fact, LPeg is Parsing Expression Grammars for Lua, which is designed to parse grammars. LPeg makes it easy to parse all kinds of grammars, for example in 400 lines of code parsing Lua source code into abstract syntax trees.</description>

Go is more suitable for writing server software, and before that I learned Socks5 protocol, so I decided to write a Socks5 proxy server. The basic function is finished, part of the idea is referred to ginuerzh/gost. I named it Subsocks, sub- meaning under &amp;hellip; (similar to &amp;ldquo;subway&amp;rdquo;). The project Repository is here: lyuhuang/subsocks. Here&amp;rsquo;s an introduction and a brief summary of its implementation.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction KCP is a fast and reliable ARQ (Automatic Repeat-reQuest) protocol that uses a different automatic retransmission policy than TCP and has a lower network latency than TCP. In practice, KCP over UDP is often used instead of TCP for online games and audio/video transmission. The implementation of KCP is short and concise, which is good for learning. The ARQ mechanism of KCP is similar to TCP, but some</description>

      <description>We know that, in general, TCP/UDP ports can only be bound to one socket. When we try to listen to a port that is already listened to by another process, the bind call fails and errno is set to 98 EADDRINUSE. This is also known as port occupation.

      <description>One of the main reasons why game servers use Lua is that it is easy to hot update. Even if the server is running, you can rewrite some of its functions for hot update purposes by simply having it execute a piece of code. For example, the module app has a function foo
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  local M = {} function M.foo(a, b) return a + b end return M   If we want to hot change foo to multiply a and b, we just need to have the server load and run the following code:</description>

      <description>In this article we discuss the Jump Consistent Hash algorithm, a minimalist and efficient consistent hashing algorithm.
Hashing and Consistent Hashing A hash function, or hash function, maps the elements of a large definition field into a small finite value field. The elements in the value domain are sometimes called buckets, and the size of the value domain is also referred to as the number of buckets.
MD5 is a common hash function that maps data of any size (the larger definition field) into a 16-byte hash (the smaller finite value field).</description>

      <description>This article mainly wants to talk about one topic - authentication. That is, how to confirm that this data is sent by this person?
User Password To solve this problem, let&amp;rsquo;s look at one of the simplest solutions - the use of passwords. Usually, to prove a person&amp;rsquo;s identity on the Internet, something private and unique about that person is needed. For example, in many places, if you provide your user name + password, you can be sure that the person is you (note: password management, strong password settings, password leaks, password cracking and password cajoling are not in this article), that is, the password is a very private matter, we can assume that only one person in the world knows this matter, so We can assume that only one person in the world can know the password, so that when the person has provided the correct password, we can authenticate the person.</description>

      <description>Many people, including myself, have long believed that TCP-based application layer protocols are simple and only require a packet header. Because TCP is a reliable protocol, it ensures that data reaches the other side in an orderly and error-free manner; it is just stream-oriented and does not preserve message boundaries, so we only need to define protocol packet headers that can distinguish individual datagrams. However, this is wrong: the transport layer protocol is limited in what it can do, and the application layer protocol can do much more than encapsulate a packet header.</description>

      <description>String matching is a very common algorithm. What it does is, for the pattern string t, find the first occurrence of it in the target string s. For example, if t = &amp;quot;abcab&amp;quot;, s = &amp;quot;ababcabd&amp;quot;, the algorithm should return 2. Talking about string matching, we have to mention the KMP algorithm. KMP is a very powerful algorithm, which is very clever and can match strings in linear time complexity.</description>

      <description>Helps you distinguish between encodeURI and encodeURIComponent usage scenarios
Background Recently, while working on the preview feature in my company, I came across a scenario of encoding the request parameters. So the question arises.
 Why is it necessary to encode a link or parameter? When do I need to encode? What is the difference between * encodeURI and encodeURIComponent?  Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at it together~
Why do you need to encode Http protocol parameter transmission is &amp;ldquo;key=value&amp;rdquo; such key-value pairs, if you want to pass more than one parameter you need to use the &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; symbol to split the key-value pairs.</description>

      <description>Tomaž Vajngerl, a developer from Collabora, has been working on a new Cairo backend, which was successfully merged into the LibreOffice codebase on Thursday; introducing another graphics backend to the open source office suite. And there have been some new follow-up commits to start moving more functionality to SvpGraphicsBackend.
SvpGraphicsBackend is LibreOffice&amp;rsquo;s new VCL (Visual Class Library) backend that contains a backend implementation of graphics drawing, using Cairo for drawing. currently, according to Vajngerl, the Cairo-based graphics drawing implementation is basically on SvpSalGraphics; however, there will be a gradual shift to SvpGraphicsBackend, just like the other vcl plugins.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that almost everyone loves unity, and having a unified development experience is something that developers have always strived for and welcomed.
Development environments have long been tightly coupled with specific technologies, such as Visual Studio, for primarily .NET-based development. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen heated debates among developers who endlessly argue for one tool over another. This will never end, nor should it, because many times these arguments result in the awesome tools we are using today.</description>

      <description>When docker mounts the disk, as many containers use root to run programs inside the container, it will cause the files generated in the mount belong to root:root. generally the user outside the container is not root, which will make file sharing or even reading logs unnecessary trouble. This article aims to solve the problem of generating root privileged files from the root without changing the container.
The files generated by docker often need to be accessed by sudo chmod o+rw *, which is troublesome, but at least you have sudo privileges.</description>

static_cast The reference scenario of static_cast compares conversions, according to CppReference, to perform static type conversions from the expression e to T in the following cases.
Common types  for the expression e can be converted from an implicit type to T If a standard conversion sequence exists for types from T to e, a static type conversion can perform the inverse of that implicit type conversion sequence.</description>

Sensor Coordinate System Each sensor has its own coordinate system, which can be divided into relative measurement (measuring environmental information) and absolute measurement (measuring its own information) according to its measurement principle. Relative sensors such as cameras and LiDAR measure environmental information for indirect positioning, while absolute sensors such as IMUs, tachometers, and GPS measure their own motion (speed, position, attitude, etc.</description>

      <description>As the hottest cloud-native monitoring tool, there is no doubt that Prometheus is a great performer. However, as we use Prometheus, the monitoring metrics stored in Prometheus become more and more frequent over time, and the frequency of queries increases, as we add more Dashboards with Grafana, we may slowly experience that Grafana is no longer able to render charts on time, and occasionally timeouts occur, especially when we are</description>

      <description>GraphQL is both a query language for the API and a runtime for your data queries. GraphQL provides a complete set of easy-to-understand descriptions of the data in your API, allowing the client to get exactly the data it needs without any redundancy, and making it easier for the API to evolve over time, as well as for building powerful developer tools.
 Over the last decade, REST has become the design standard for Web APIs, providing some great ideas such as stateless servers and structured access to resources.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest disadvantages of Maven, which is often compared to Gradle, is that Maven builds slowly, Gradle builds 2 to 10 times faster than Maven, and today Maven can be faster as well. The Apache Maven team took inspiration from Gradle and Takari (Maven lifecycle optimizer) to make enhancements to Maven, resulting in the maven-mvnd project.
Brief introduction mvnd is not a refactoring of Maven, but rather has Maven built in.</description>

      <description>Suppose there is a requirement that the Rust binary compiled in a fedora high version (2.34) glibc environment should be used in the customer&amp;rsquo;s centos7 glibc 2.17 environment, because the files compiled by the high version glibc will not work in the low version glibc environment
A possible solution is that the musl-gcc/musl-clang compiler makes the binary not strongly dependent on the glibc version, e.g. TabNine&amp;rsquo;s binary on Linux is musl&amp;rsquo;s</description>

      <title>Why you shouldn&#39;t accept code with race</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/why-you-should-reject-racy-code/</guid>
      <description>In any language concurrent programming scenario, there is a race problem. Modern languages have two ideas to solve the race problem, one is to restrict the user from writing race code as much as possible by ownership+Sync/Send like rust, and one is to check for data contention during testing by race detector like Go.
The design of Go&amp;rsquo;s race detector means that it can&amp;rsquo;t be turned on in an online environment, and many companies don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a race test before they go live, which leads some Gophers to think that it&amp;rsquo;s okay if I write race code because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;eventually consistent&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>According to the description of the Go generalization proposal, Go does not support generalized methods:No parameterized methods. The main reason Go generic processing is implemented at compile time, and generic methods are difficult to determine how the generic scheme should be instantiated without contextual analysis and inference at compile time, or even impossible to determine, resulting in the current (Go 1.18) Go implementation not supporting generic schemes.

      <description>The software world is evolving faster than ever, and the need to stay competitive requires new software releases as quickly as possible, without impacting users online. Many enterprises have migrated their workloads to Kubernetes clusters, which inherently take into account some production environment practices, but there are some additional things we need to do to make Kubernetes truly zero downtime without disruption or lost requests.
Rolling Updates By default, Kubernetes Deployment has a rolling update policy for Pod updates, which ensures that some instances are still running when the application is updated at any point in time to prevent the application from going down, and only kills the old Pod when the newly deployed Pod is up and ready to handle traffic.</description>

Explain in a human word: URL to locate resources, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to describe the operation.
Resources
A &amp;ldquo;resource&amp;rdquo; is an entity on the Web, or a specific piece of information on the Web. It can be a piece of text, a picture, a song, a service, in short, a concrete reality.</description>

However, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply put the project in the DropBox directory, because that would cause every simple save to initiate a file sync, and some temporary file changes during compilation would cause the DropBox to sync, which would drive the CPU usage of the computer very high.</description>

      <description>Many times we may directly expose private information such as application passwords or API Token in the source code, which is obviously not a good way to expose such private information. The Kubernetes system provides a Secret object to store private data, but it is only a simple Base64 encoding, which is better than exposing it directly, but it is still not enough to use Secret directly for applications with</description>

      <description>You can use reflect.DeepEqual and cmp.Equal to compare two structs of the same type to see if they are equal, or you can use hard-coded comparisons, see below how they perform.
Define a struct with multiple data types, e.g.
1 2 3 4 5 6  type T struct { X int Y string Z []int M map[string]string }   reflect.DeepEqual This is a built-in function

      <description>Normally, when a client in the cluster connects to the service, the Pod supporting the service can get the IP address of the client, but when the connection is received through the node port, the source IP address of the packet will change because of the Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) performed on the packet, and the Pod on the backend cannot see the actual client IP, which is a problem for some applications, for example, the request log of nginx cannot get the exact IP of the client access.</description>

      <description>A Dockerfile is the starting point for creating a Docker image, which provides a well-defined set of instructions that allow us to copy files or folders, run commands, set environment variables, and perform other tasks needed to create a container image. It is important to write Dockerfile to ensure that the generated images are safe, small, fast to build and fast to update.
In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to write good Dockerfiles to speed up the development process, ensure build reusability, and generate images that are safe to deploy to production.</description>

It is very easy to launch a development environment in Kubernetes with one click through Okteto. We have also introduced the Skaffold tool from Google, and today we will demonstrate how to use Okteto to build Python application development environment.
Installation We just need to install the Okteto CLI tool on our local development machine. To use Okteto to configure the environment we need to have access to a Kubernetes cluster on our local machine, so The prerequisite is to configure a kubeconfig file for an accessible Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>

      <description>For a production environment and an aspiring ops person, even millisecond level downtime is not tolerated. Proper logging and monitoring of infrastructure and applications is very helpful in solving problems, and can also help optimize costs and resources, as well as help detect some problems that may occur later. In this article we will use the more lightweight Grafana Loki to implement log monitoring and alerting. The key thing is that if you are familiar with using Prometheus, you will have no problem using Loki, as they are basically the same, and have the same Label tag if they are auto-discovered in a Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>KinD is a very lightweight Kubernetes installation tool that treats Docker containers as Kubernetes nodes, making it very easy to use. Since you can run a Kubernetes cluster in a Docker container, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to wonder if you can run it in a Pod. What are the problems with running in a Pod?
Installing Docker Daemon in a Pod KinD is now dependent on Docker, so first we need to create an image that allows us to run Docker Deamon in the Pod, so that we can execute commands like docker run inside the Pod, but this is not the same as the DIND mode of mounting docker.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about GitOps practices before, and we know that GitOps advocates managing all of your configuration through Git and versioning your environment configuration and infrastructure through declarative code.
In Kubernetes, we know that you can use resource manifest files to manage a cluster&amp;rsquo;s resource objects, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to store Kubernetes Secrets data in a Git repository, which is also very insecure.
Kubernetes Secrets are resource objects used to help us store sensitive information, such as passwords, keys, certificates, OAuth Token, SSH KEY, etc.</description>

      <description>The specific issue to be analyzed today is &amp;lsquo;why DNS uses the UDP protocol&amp;rsquo;. DNS acts as a phone book for the entire Internet, translating domain names that can be understood by humans into IP addresses that can be understood by machines, eliminating the need for users of the Internet to have direct access to IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand.
I believe that it is common knowledge among software engineers that DNS uses the UDP protocol, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS uses the UDP protocol to transfer data, but this is not entirely true.</description>

However, TCP was not designed with today&amp;rsquo;s complex network environment in mind, and when you are tormented by intermittent networks on the subway or train, you may not even know that it may all be caused by the TCP protocol. This article will analyze why the TCP protocol has serious performance problems in weak network environments</description>

      <description>The two transport protocols, UDP and TCP, are core members of the IP protocol cluster. The RFC 768, published in 1980, defines the UDP protocol, which allows us to pass data across a network of multiple computer connections. The common DNS protocol can use the UDP protocol to obtain the results of domain name resolution
UDP is the simplest protocol that can transmit data, and its protocol header (also called protocol header) is only 8 bytes.</description>

      <description>Arrays and slices are common data structures in the Go language, and many developers new to Go tend to confuse these two concepts. In addition to arrays, Go introduces another concept - slicing. Slicing has some similarities to arrays, but their differences lead to significant differences in usage. In this section we will introduce the underlying implementation of arrays from the Go compile-time runtime, which will include several common operations for initializing, accessing, and assigning values to arrays.</description>

      <description>Go is a programming language with few syntactic elements and a simple design, which often means less expressiveness and more time for engineers to write repetitive logic. There has been a lot of community discussion and outcry about generics, and here are some of the discussions and feedback related to generics.
 proposal: spec: generic programming facilities has over 500 generic-related discussions. Generics - ExperienceReports lists a number of articles discussing Go language generics.</description>

      <description>Database management systems are an important part of software today. Open source databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and commercial Oracle are everywhere, and almost all services rely on database management systems to store data.
It sounds like a matter of course that a database will not lose data, and persistence capability should be the most basic guarantee of a database, but in this complex world it is very difficult to guarantee that data will not be lost.</description>

      <description>Many systems have daemons that monitor the running state of the system in the background and respond to unexpected situations as they arise. The system monitor is an important part of the Go language runtime, checking the Go language runtime at regular intervals to ensure that the program has not entered an abnormal state. This section describes the design and implementation of the Go system monitor, including its startup, execution process, and main responsibilities.</description>

      <description>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has become the most commonly used application layer protocol on the Internet, however, it is only a network protocol for transmitting hypertext and does not provide any security guarantees, using plaintext to transmit packets over the Internet makes eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks possible. Transmitting passwords over HTTP is actually similar to running around naked on the Internet.
Netscape designed the HTTPS protocol in 1994 to secure data transfers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and with the development of Transport Layer Security (TLS), we now use TLS instead of the deprecated SSL protocol, although the term SSL certificate is still used.</description>

      <description>The data and variables in a program are allocated to the virtual memory where the program resides, which contains two important areas: the Stack and the Heap. Most of the arguments, return values, and local variables of function calls are allocated to the stack, which is managed by the compiler; different programming languages use different methods to manage the memory in the heap area.

      <description>The TCP/IP protocol cluster establishes a conceptual model for communication protocols in the Internet, and the two main protocols in the cluster are TCP and IP. TCP in the TCP/IP protocol cluster guarantees the reliability and order of data segments, and with a reliable transport layer protocol, application layer protocols can directly use TCP to transfer data without the need to care about Loss and duplication of data segments
The IP protocol solves the routing and transmission of packets, and the upper layer TCP protocol is no longer concerned with routing and addressing.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-tcp-time-wait/</guid>
      <description>The TCP protocol contains 11 different states, and the TCP connection transitions states based on the messages sent or received. The state machine shown below illustrates all possible transitions, including not only the state transition process under normal conditions, but also the state transition under abnormal conditions.
Both parties communicating using the TCP protocol will trigger the TIME_WAIT state when closing the connection. The operation of closing the connection actually tells the other party to the communication that it has no data to send, but it still maintains the ability to receive data from the other party, a common process of closing the connection is as follows.</description>

      <description>You should be careful about setting the CPU limit for loads in k8s. A value that is too small can introduce extra, meaningless latency into your program, and a value that is too large can introduce too large a blast radius and weaken the overall stability of the cluster.
request and limit One of the major benefits of k8s is resource isolation. By setting the request and limit of the load, we can easily allow different programs to coexist on the right node.</description>

      <description>In almost all modern programming languages, the garbage collector is a complex system that requires a lot of effort in order to reclaim the deprecated memory without affecting the user program. Java&amp;rsquo;s garbage collection mechanism is a good example. Java 8 contains four garbage collectors, linear, concurrent, parallel marker removal, and G1.

Although it lacks serialization and deserialization performance compared to more compact data interchange formats, JSON offers good readability and ease of use, and it is a very good choice for using JSON as a serialization format when extreme mechanical performance is not sought.
Design Principles Almost all modern programming languages incorporate functions for handling JSON directly into the standard library, and the Go language is no exception.</description>

All processes running in the current operating system share the CPU and memory resources in the system, and the operating system uses CPU scheduler to allocate CPU time and introduces virtual memory system to manage physical memory.
Before we can answer the need for virtual memory, we need to understand what virtual memory is in an operating system and what role it plays in the operating system.</description>

      <description>When we work with relational databases, the primary key is a concept that cannot be avoided. The primary key acts as an identifier for a record, and we can locate a unique record in a table by its identifier.
In a relational database, we choose the smallest subset of multiple fields in a record as the unique identifier for that record in the table. Depending on the definition of a primary key in a relational database, we can choose either a single column as the primary key or multiple columns as the primary key, but the primary key must exist and be unique throughout the record.</description>

      <description>The network layer protocol assumes the two major functions of packet forwarding and routing, and it can provide the upper layer with the responsibility of transporting packets between different hosts. IP protocol, as a network layer protocol, plays an extremely critical role in today&amp;rsquo;s Internet, although it can only provide connectionless and unreliable services.
In general, when we want to access services provided by other hosts, we need to access the target host through an IP address, which is the only way to be accessed by other hosts on the Internet.</description>

Because the Overlay network is a virtual network built on top of another computer network, it cannot stand alone, and the network on which the Overlay layer depends is the Underlay network, and the two concepts often appear in pairs.</description>

      <description>A system call is a way for a computer program to request services from the operating system kernel during execution. This may include hardware-related services, the creation and execution of new processes, and process scheduling. Anyone with a little knowledge of operating systems knows that - system calls provide the user program with an interface to the operating system.
The famous glibc for C language encapsulates the system calls provided by the operating system and provides a well-defined interface that allows engineers to develop upper-level applications directly using the functions encapsulated in the container.</description>

      <title>Why is the default page size for Linux 4KB?</title>

      <description>We all know that Linux manages memory in pages. Whether it is loading data from disk into memory or writing data from memory back to disk, the operating system operates in pages. Even if we write only one byte of data to disk, we need to swipe the entire data from the entire page to disk.
Linux supports both normal-sized memory pages and large memory pages (Huge Page). The default size of memory pages on most processors is 4KB, and although some processors use 8KB, 16KB, or 64KB as the default page size, 4KB pages are still the mainstream of the default memory page configuration of the operating system; in addition to the normal memory page size, different processors also contain large pages of different sizes.</description>

      <description>When we want to store data persistently, using relational databases is often the safest choice, not only because of the richness and stability of today&amp;rsquo;s relational databases, but also because the support for relational databases in different communities is very complete. In this article, we will analyze an important concept in relational databases - Foreign Key.
In a relational database, a foreign key, also known as a relational key, is a set of columns that provide a connection between relational tables in a relational database.</description>

      <description>Mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) are the two most common types of hard drives used as external storage for computers, and it takes a long time for the CPU to access the data they store, as shown in the table below, where it takes 1,500 times longer to access a random 4KB of data in an SSD than it does to access the main memory, and 100,000 times longer to seek a mechanical disk than it does to access the main memory.</description>

      <description>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer memory design approach, as opposed to Uniform Memory Access (UMA), also known as Symmetric Multi-Processor Architecture (SMP), which was used by early computers, but most modern computers use NUMA architecture to manage CPU and memory resources.
As application developers, we are less likely to need direct access to hardware because the operating system shields us from many hardware-level implementation details. However, because NUMA affects applications, NUMA is something we must understand and be familiar with if we want to write high-performance, low-latency services, and this article will cover its impact in two ways.</description>

      <description>Memory is an important resource for computers, and while most services today do not require as much memory, databases and Hadoop services are big consumers of memory, consuming GBs and TBs of memory to speed up computations in production environments.
The Linux operating system has introduced a number of strategies to manage this memory better and faster and reduce overhead, and today we are going to introduce HugePages, or large pages.</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows a little bit about Linux knows that Linux divides the physical Random Access Memory (RAM) into 4KB-sized memory blocks by page, and the Swapping mechanism we are going to introduce today is closely related to memory, which is the process of the operating system copying the contents of physical memory pages to the swap space on the hard disk to release the memory. The physical memory and the swap partition on the hard disk make up the virtual memory available on the operating system, and these swap spaces are pre-configured by the system administrator.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we would like to present a paper from the 2018 ATC Journal &amp;ndash; NanoLog: A Nanosecond Scale Logging System, which implements NanoLog, a high-performance logging system that can perform 1 ~ 2 orders of magnitude better than other logging systems in the C++ community, e.g., spdlog, glog, and Boost Log. In this article, we will briefly analyze the design and implementation principles of NanoLog.
Logging is an important part of system observability, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many engineers have had the experience of adding logs on the fly to check for problems, a process the author has just re-visited.</description>

      <description>ClickHouse is one of the more popular online analytical processing (OLAP) data stores recently. Compared to our common traditional relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, data stores such as ClickHouse, Hive and HBase for online analytical processing (OLAP) scenarios tend to use columnar storage.
Readers who know a little about databases know that Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) are the two most common scenarios of databases, and these two scenarios are not the only two, from which there are also concepts derived from Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP).</description>

      <description>Disk for persistent storage is not a scarce resource today, but CPU and memory are still relatively expensive resources, and this article will describe how memory, a scarce resource in computers, is managed.
Memory management systems and modules play an important role in operating systems and programming languages. The use of any resource is inseparable from the two actions of requesting and releasing, and two important processes in memory management are memory allocation and garbage collection, and how a memory management system can use limited memory resources to provide services to as many programs or modules as possible is its core goal.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and Docker has played a pivotal role in containers from its inception to today, and is the default container engine in Kubernetes. However, in December 2020, the Kubernetes community decided to move forward with removing Dockershim-related code from its repositories, which was significant for both the Kubernetes and Docker communities.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure most developers have heard of Kubernetes and Docker and know that we can use Kubernetes to manage Docker containers, but they may not have heard of Dockershim, the Docker shim.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a very complex cluster orchestration system, yet even though it contains rich functionality and features, it cannot meet the needs of all scenarios because of the inherent high complexity of container scheduling and management. While Kubernetes can solve most of the common problems in most scenarios, in order to achieve a more flexible strategy, we need to use the scalability provided by Kubernetes for specific purposes.
Each project will focus on different features at different cycles, and we can simply divide the evolution of the project into three distinct phases.</description>

      <description>This paper is about the paper in the 2020 NSDI Journal &amp;ndash; Firecracker: Lightweight Virtualization for Serverless Applications, which implements Firecracker to provide lightweight virtualization support on the host. Many developers today choose to use Serverless containers and services to reduce system overhead, improve hardware resource utilization, and enable rapid scaling, but the Serverless scenario places higher demands on container isolation, security, and performance.
When serving multiple tenants with the same hardware, we expect the different workloads to be isolated for security and performance with minimal additional overhead.</description>

      <description>I remember a dozen years ago when I was still using the early Windows system, every time the system would become very laggy, then you need to open the system provides the following disk defragmentation program, when the defragmentation is complete will feel the system becomes slightly smoother some.
In the file system, defragmentation is the process of reducing fragmentation in the file system, which rearranges the contents of the same files on the disk in order and uses compression algorithms to remove gaps between files, somewhat similar to the tag compression algorithm in garbage collection.</description>

      <description>The pattern of development of most things in the world is similar. In the beginning, relatively general solutions tend to appear to solve most problems, followed by solutions specifically designed for a certain scenario that do not solve general problems but perform extremely well in some specific areas. In the field of computing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are general-purpose and specific solutions, respectively, with the former providing the most basic computing power to solve almost any problem, and the latter excelling in areas such as graphics computing and machine learning.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/whys-the-design-linux-macos-fragmentation/</guid>
      <description>I believe that many software engineers today use Linux or macOS systems, and unlike Windows, we hardly see the concept of disk defragmentation. From personal experience, the author has not defragmented a disk in macOS for the past seven or eight years, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any related operations in today&amp;rsquo;s disk tools, only the diskutil command to set whether a disk is defragmented on or off.
Windows operating systems may need to defragment their disks every once in a while, and there are two reasons behind this problem: one is that Windows uses a very simple file system called FAT, which is designed in such a way that the same files may be scattered in different locations on the disk, and the other is that solid state drives were not popular in the ancient times and mechanical hard drives have poor random read and write performance.</description>

      <description>Swap in Linux is similar to virtual memory in Windows, which means that when there is a shortage of memory, a portion of the hard disk space can be used as virtual memory, thus solving the problem of insufficient memory capacity.
When installing a Linux system you need to set up a separate swap partition while Windows installation does not have this requirement, mainly because of the different ways of implementation.</description>

In this context of universal learning and use of Kubernetes, it is also important to be very clear about what the limitations of Kubernetes are.</description>

      <description>When you think of Redis, you think of Memcached, and vice versa. Those who know both have a general impression that Redis supports simple key-value data types compared to Memcached, and also provides storage for data structures such as list, set, zset, and hash; redis supports data backup, redis supports data persistence, and it looks like redis is more powerful than memcached. The redis support for data backup, redis support for data persistence, looks redis than memcached more awesome, so in fact is this not the case?</description>

      <description>When using Prometheus for monitoring, alerting is done through AlertManager, but there are many people who are confused about the configuration related to alerting and are not quite sure when exactly it will be done. Here we will briefly introduce a few confusing parameters in AlertManager. First of all, there are two global parameters scrape_interval and evaluation_interval in Prometheus. The scrape_interval parameter represents the time interval at which Prometheus grabs</description>

What is TokuDB? The most popular MySQL engine that supports full transactions is INNODB, which is characterized by the fact that the data itself is organized by B-TREE, which is a huge B-TREE index clustered by primary key. So at this point, the write speed will be somewhat reduced, because to write each time to use an IO to do the index tree rearrangement.</description>

      <description>In computer science, fuzzy string matching is a technique for finding a string that matches a pattern approximately (rather than exactly). In other words, fuzzy string matching is a search that finds a match even if the user misspells a word or enters only part of a word to search. Therefore, it is also known as string approximate matching. String fuzzy search can be used in various applications, such as</description>

      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>As Kubernetes releases iterate, many Helm Chart packages simply cannot keep up with the updates, resulting in many Helm Chart packages being incompatible when using newer versions of Kubernetes, so it is necessary to consider compatibility with different versions of Kubernetes when developing Helm Chart packages.
The core of achieving compatibility with different versions is to make use of the built-in object Capabilities provided by the Helm Chart template, which provides information about Kubernetes cluster support features, including the following features.</description>

      <description>Introduction to MQTT MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an instant messaging protocol developed by IBM. It is designed with lightness, openness, simplicity, and specification in mind, and is therefore easy to implement. These features make it a good choice for many scenarios, including constrained environments such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things environments (IoT) that require very small code packages or very expensive network bandwidth.
The MQTT protocol is a protocol designed for the communication of a large number of remote sensors and control devices with limited computing power and operating on low-bandwidth, unreliable networks, and has several key features, as follows.</description>

      <description>Linux is a multi-user, multi-tasking system, often with multiple people working on a single machine at the same time. To protect everyone&amp;rsquo;s privacy, the role of &amp;ldquo;file owner&amp;rdquo; is quite important. When a Linux user logs on to the system, he or she carries a User ID (UID) and a Group ID (GID), which are equivalent to his or her business cards. When you need to access a file or</description>

      <description>Introduction to Package Management Systems There was a time when software was distributed via FTP or mailing lists (i.e., patch packages with source code distributed via mailing lists) (eventually these distribution methods evolved, thanks to the rapid growth of the Internet, into one of the common software distribution sites of today). （There is only one very small file (usually in a tar file) that contains</description>

      <description>What is a hash ? Hash is the transformation of an input of arbitrary length (also called pre-image) into an output of fixed length by a hashing algorithm, and that output is the hash value. This transformation is a compressed mapping, i.e., the space for the hash value is usually much smaller than the space for the input, and different inputs may be hashed into the same output, and it is not possible to uniquely determine the input value from the hash value.</description>

      <description>As we all know, storing plaintext passwords is a very bad thing. If a database stores a plaintext password, if the data is leaked, then the user account is in danger. Because of this, back in 1976, industry came up with a set of standards for storing passwords securely using a one-way hashing mechanism (starting with Unix Crypt). Unfortunately, while this approach prevents you from reading the password directly, all the hashing mechanism does is prevent an attacker from brute-force cracking it in an offline environment, where the attacker simply traverses a list of possible passwords containing the correct password, hashes each possible password and then compares it to the obtained password (the one stored using the hashing mechanism).</description>

      <description>The datediff function in Hive SQL returns the number of days between 2 dates. One of the more interesting pitfalls found during use is that

The following code is executed and the result also has problems.

In ordinary Web applications, developers often struggle with XML parsing, either server-side generation or processing of XML, or client-side parsing of XML with JavaScript, often resulting in complex code and very low development efficiency. In fact, for most Web applications, many AJAX applications even return pieces of HTML directly to</description>

      <description>In the stand-alone era, the use of a single disk for data storage and read/write resulted in very low I/O performance due to addressing and read/write time consumption, and the storage capacity would also be limited. In addition, a single disk is extremely prone to physical failure, often resulting in data loss. Therefore, people wonder if there is a way to combine multiple independent disks together to form a technical solution to improve data reliability and I/O performance.</description>

If it exists, we will update the expiration time of this cookie (after 30 minutes). That is, as long as the user visits the interval within 30 minutes is considered the same Seesion, more than 30 minutes will generate a new SeesionId and define browsing as a new Session.</description>

      <description>There are two types of loops you can use in Python: for loops and while loops. You can use them for repetitive tasks. As a result, repetitive tasks will happen automatically, making the process more efficient. Unfortunately, you may run into some problems with your loops. Sometimes your program may run into problems that require it to skip a part of the loop or exit the loop altogether. Or you may need it to ignore external factors that affect the program.</description>

      <description>What is an exception? An exception is an event that occurs during program execution and affects the normal execution of the program. Typically, an exception occurs when Python is unable to process a program properly. Exceptions are Python objects that represent an error. When an exception occurs in a Python script we need to catch it and handle it, otherwise the program will terminate execution. When an uncaught exception occurs,</description>

      <description>Python&amp;rsquo;s design philosophy is &amp;ldquo;small core language&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;large standard library&amp;rdquo;, so when Python wants to add a new feature, it is more likely to think about whether to add it to the core language support or put it into the library as an extension. library is very large and contains many modules. To use a function, you must import the corresponding module in advance, otherwise the function is invalid.</description>

      <description>In the process of learning Python, or reading other code written to it, you will encounter code like this.
1 2  if __name__ == &amp;#34;__main__&amp;#34;: print(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;)   We found that even if we remove the if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;, the program still runs as usual. Many of you only know that this is how it works, and you don&amp;rsquo;t look deeper into what exactly it does.

      <description>What is a with statement? The with statement is a feature related to exception handling introduced in Python 2.6. The with statement is used when accessing resources to ensure that the necessary &amp;ldquo;cleanup&amp;rdquo; operations are performed to release resources, such as automatic closure of files after use, automatic acquisition and release of locks in threads, and so on, regardless of whether an exception occurs during use. automatically after a file is used, automatic acquisition and release of locks in threads, etc.</description>

      <description>Python error Unable to find vcvarsall.bat error is the most impressive problem I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered when installing Python packages on Windows platforms. This solution was compiled on September 10, 2012. Nine years have passed, and I believe there are still many of you who encountered similar problems. I took the time to recreate the previous solution and sort it out. The main change is to add the solution under Python2.
Problem Cause If the package/module you installed has contents written in cpython, you need to compile the middle C code into a binary file before the installation can be completed successfully.</description>

      <description>Apache Kafka is the most popular distributed messaging publish-subscribe system available today. While Kafka is very powerful, it is equally complex and requires a highly available and robust platform to run. In a world where microservices are prevalent and most companies are adopting distributed computing, it is still very advantageous to use Kafka as a core messaging system.
If you run your microservices in a Kubernetes cluster, it makes sense to run a Kafka cluster in Kubernetes to take advantage of its built-in resiliency and high availability, and we can easily interact with Kafka Pods within the cluster using the built-in Kubernetes service discovery.</description>

      <description>A pointer is an address value that points to the start of an area of memory. So you need to have a good knowledge of computer composition principles. Generally speaking, it is important to maintain a deep memory of what is told in this course and then accumulate it day by day to really reach an understanding.
The concept of a pointer in a high-level language is not fundamentally different from a pointer on a low-level interface.</description>

      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
 etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve shared tips on file IO, and I vaguely remember the last time I did so.
Kirito is also working on the topic &amp;ldquo;RocketMQ Storage System Design for Hot and Cold Read/Write Scenarios&amp;rdquo;, but we are participating in the internal track, so we can&amp;rsquo;t rank with our external partners.
As we all know, storage design is inseparable from file IO, and storing data in files for persistence is a regular operation in most message queues and database systems.</description>

      <description>Today we share a pitfall that many people tend to step in: the use of HeapByteBuffer.
ByteBuffer has two main implementation classes
 HeapByteBuffer In-heap memory DirectByteBuffer Off-heap memory  In my personal experience, I tend to use DirectByteBuffer in most cases, both for read and write operations, mainly because HeapByteBuffer may have some unexpected internal operations when interacting with FileChannel, which is the caveat mentioned in the title of this article, so let&amp;rsquo;s sell it here.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Stream was first introduced in JDK1.8, nearly 8 years ago (JDK1.8 was released at the end of 2013), and the introduction of Stream greatly simplified some development scenarios, but on the other hand, it may have reduced the readability of the code (it is true that many people say that Stream will reduce the readability of the code, but in my opinion, the readability of the code is improved</description>

      <description>In the past, a simple text editor was sufficient for developers to create and manage most projects. But the WEB has changed radically since then, and today, even a fairly simple project usually has hundreds of scripts with complex nested dependencies that simply can&amp;rsquo;t be managed in an orderly fashion without an automation tool, which is where a package manager comes into play.
A package manager is a tool that automates the handling of project dependencies in various ways.</description>

      <description>Visitor Pattern The accessor pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows arbitrary detached visitors to be able to access managed elements under the control of the manager. The visitor cannot change the definition of the object (but this is not mandatory, you can agree to allow changes). For the manager, it does not care how many visitors there actually are, it only cares about a defined order of access to the elements (for example, for a binary tree, you can provide multiple access orders such as mid-order, pre-order, etc.</description>

      <description>Writing an HTTP service in Go is easy, but getting a running service to exit safely is not so straightforward. If you are new to the term graceful shutdown, it refers to an HTTP service that stops accepting new requests after receiving a user&amp;rsquo;s exit command, and then actively exits after processing and responding to the batch of requests it is currently processing. Unlike SIGKILL (kill -9 or force stop),</description>

In many scenarios, we will do network security attack prevention or access risk control based on the client request IP. Usually, we can get the real IP through the X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP protocol Request Headers, but is it really reliable to get the real IP through the X-Forwarded-For header? Concept The X-Forwarded-For is</description>

      <description>Type definition is a necessary but tedious process in developing with TypeScript.
When a third-party library method needs to be defined separately, and the library does not export the method&amp;rsquo;s input type, you need to get the method&amp;rsquo;s input type.
For example, there is the following example function, we want to get its parameter type and return value type, so how should we implement it.
Example function.
1 2 3 4 5 6  function test(lzwme: string, idx: number) { return { lzwme, idx, }; }   Get the parameter type of the function Use the predefined Parameters to get a list of parameter types for a function.</description>

      <description>Sensitive message exchange has relatively strong requirements for correctness and security. Using a message digest algorithm to calculate and verify the digest of the message body prevents the message from being tampered with during transmission as an illegal message value; using an encryption algorithm to encrypt the message body prevents the message from being intercepted and read during transmission. The combination of the two can achieve a strong secure message</description>

      <description>Compared to React 16, the new features of React17 are featureless, so the upgrade from 16 to 17 is relatively smooth. One disruptive change, however, is the change in the event system. In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the document level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered. Exceptions are thrown wherever document.addEventListener is used</description>

      <description>Someone recommended this article before, Complexity has to live somewhere, the general idea is that the complexity of the system can&amp;rsquo;t just disappear, it can only be transferred from one place to another, because there is so much logic in the real world, there are so many cases around the corner that you have to deal with, which will inevitably introduce complexity into the system.
Although these complexities you can transfer to your colleagues or outsource to third-party systems, the complexity is indefinite.</description>

In many articles, it is recommended to inherit from the QThread class and override the run method to use time-consuming manipulation code in run. This approach makes us think that QThread is the entity of the thread. Creating a QThread object is thought of as opening a new thread.</description>

      <description>Arch uses the pacman package manager and the package format is tar.zst. Arch provides a number of tools for creating tar.zst packages, first you need to install the base-devel package and the devtools package.
1  pacman -S base-devel devtools   Arch&amp;rsquo;s packaging process works like this, starting with writing a PKGBUILD file that describes all the information needed to build a package, such as where to download the source code from, what the dependencies are, what the build version is, how to build, etc.</description>

      <description>The company&amp;rsquo;s PaaS platform uses the open source kubespray for the underlying kubernetes cluster deployment, and I was involved in the kubespray second-opening work. During this period, I mainly completed kubespray automated packaging and release pipeline, private deployment, added self-research CNI deployment, and some bugfixes. I recently took time to organize and summarize some of the pitfalls of using kubespray to deploy kubernetes clusters for local development and testing. Prepare</description>

      <description>Mozilla this week enabled automatic Tab Unloading for Firefox Nightly on Windows, which significantly improves low memory usage and reduces the likelihood of browser crashes.
Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s development of Firefox Tab Unloading began more than 10 years ago, but Mozilla has never enabled the feature in any of the browser&amp;rsquo;s previous releases. Tab Unloading was stalled two years ago due to detection of low memory errors.
Tab unloading is now a feature in Firefox Nightly for Windows, which is currently in version 93 and is expected to be released in Firefox 93 for Windows later this year.</description>

      <description>Tensorflow is a Python based machine learning and artificial intelligence project developed by Google. Recently TensorFlow has dropped support for YAML in order to fix a critical code execution vulnerability.
AML or YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language is a human-readable data serialization language used to pass objects and store data between processes and applications, and many Python applications use YAML to serialize and deserialize objects.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-37678, and the maintainers of TensorFlow and Keras, a wrapper project for TensorFlow, say that the vulnerability stems from an insecure parsing of YAML, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when an application deserializes a Keras model served in YAML format.</description>

      <description>I am temporarily unemployed, so this article does not represent the views of any employer.
By 2021, most companies have decided to embrace cloud-native, but many programmers&#39; understanding of cloud-native is limited to &amp;ldquo;native k8s-based applications&amp;rdquo;. If a company goes to the cloud (k8s), it&amp;rsquo;s embracing cloud-native. Those with a little more understanding think that if we go to service mesh in addition to k8s, we are embracing cloud-native.
The cncf&amp;rsquo;s definition of cloud-native is in fact very complex.</description>

      <description>GitHub has released a blog post stating that it is taking steps to improve the security of its hosted code repositories. It will now be necessary to use the encrypted Git protocol when pushing and pulling Git data. These changes will affect some of the keys supported in SSH, and according to the Git Systems team, unencrypted Git protocols will now be a thing of the past.
Specifically, GitHub no longer supports DSA keys (Digital Signature Algorithm), and some traditional SSH algorithms such as HMAC-SHA-1 and CBC are no longer available.</description>

      <description>Certain business requirements require tracking access to our http service, that is, logging the requests and responses. The basic logging dimension contains request parameters (path query parameters, request body), request path (uri), request method (method), request headers (headers), and response status, response headers, and even contains sensitive response bodies, etc. Today summarizes several methods, you can choose as needed.
How request tracking is implemented Gateway Many gateway facilities have httptrace capabilities that help us centrally log request traffic.</description>

      <description>Qt has published a blog post comparing Qt 6.2 LTS with Qt 5.15, stating that Qt 6.2 LTS will completely override Qt 5.15.
When Qt 6.0 debuted last year, most of the criticism came from the fact that it didn&amp;rsquo;t port all the modules and features from Qt5, and that Qt Inc. limited the Qt 5.15 LTS release to paying customers only. Since then, developers have been working to address these missing elements in Qt6, and with the upcoming Qt 6.</description>

      <description>TypeScript officials have announced a new homepage for their website to better introduce users to TypeScript.
In the article, the official says that the previous homepage had a number of problems, such as no obvious call-to-action phrase at the top of the site, too much text explaining concepts, a lack of focus due to the visual weight between sections of the site, and not enough code examples. Finally, an A/B test was carried out with users of the site to see if any new users liked the homepage, but the results were essentially 50/50.</description>

      <description>You can use generics in Go 1.17. The current master branch, by default, already supports generics, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to add the -G=3 parameter.
You can try the latest branch of go by following these steps:
1 2  go get golang.org/dl/gotip gotip download   Just use the gotip command instead of go when compiling your code.
With the release of Go 1.17, there have been a lot of articles on Go generics, but they are basically brief introductory articles.</description>

      <description>A lawsuit that has been going on for nearly 20 years and was thought to threaten the very existence of Linux has finally come to an end.
The lawsuit began in 2003, but the events behind it date back to 1998. At the time, IBM and Santa Cruz Operation (SCO - the vendor of UNIX for x86 CPU devices) joined forces with other companies to create the &amp;ldquo;Monterey&amp;rdquo; project to create a version of UNIX that would run on multiple hardware platforms - this was what the Linux community was doing at the time.</description>

      <description>Go 1.17 changed the long-standing stack-based calling convention. Before we can understand Go&amp;rsquo;s calling convention, we need to know what it is. The x86 calling convention is, in a nutshell, the language&amp;rsquo;s convention for passing parameters between functions. The caller knows what parameters to pass to the called function in what form and in what order, and the called function follows this convention to find the contents of the passed</description>

In order to implement Effectively once, pulsar supports it in two ways.
 Effectively-once publishing: ensuring that messages are sent only once Effectively-once consumer: ensuring that messages are consumed only once  Effectively-once publishing pulsar supports the guarantee that only one copy of a message will be stored in pulsar in the event of extreme conditions such as broker failure, producer failure, network failure, etc.</description>

      <description>Today, security vulnerabilities are increasingly plaguing large open source projects. According to RiskSense statistics, the number of open source software vulnerabilities more than doubled in 2019 compared to 2018. Considering that nearly 91 percent of commercial applications contain outdated or deprecated open source components, the impact of security vulnerabilities is far-reaching.
As a member of the open source software community, Google is well aware of the growing threat to open source projects posed by software supply chain attacks, and Allstar is its latest tool to improve security.</description>

      <description>Web technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, but there is one area that has been impossible to break through &amp;mdash;- games.
The performance requirements for games are so high that some large games struggle to run even on a PC, let alone in the sandbox model of a browser! However, despite the difficulties, many developers have never given up and want to make browsers run 3D games.
In 2012, Alon Zakai, an engineer at Mozilla, was working on the LLVM compiler and had the idea that many 3D games are written in C/C++, so if we could compile C/C++ into JavaScript code, they would run in the browser.</description>

      <description>When it comes to front-end performance optimization, we usually think of enabling compression to compress the resource file size. Or enabling browser caching can have the effect of optimizing resource loading speed with fewer HTTP requests, but these means mainly improve the loading speed when repeatedly accessing the same resources. By default, the browser will only load resources declared in HTML first. If it is not declared, the browser will not load the resource earlier.</description>

      <description>WireGuard author Jason Donenfeld recently announced the WireGuardNT project, a native port of WireGuard for the Windows kernel. Like the other versions, WireGuardNT, lowercase &amp;ldquo;wireguard-nt&amp;rdquo;, started out as a port of the Linux version of the codebase. After a successful initial porting effort, the NT codebase quickly diverged to better fit the native NTisms and NDIS (Windows Network Stack) APIs, and the end result was a deeply integrated and high-performance WireGuard implementation for the NT kernel that leverages the full functionality of the NT kernel and NDIS.</description>

As long as users have some observation of others around them, they will find that more and more users have switched to Chromium-based browsers instead of Firefox.
Recently, Firefox published its public data report since 2018, and the official report is a further confirmation of users&#39; observations.</description>

      <description>Microsoft and Google are working on a new API for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge called &amp;ldquo;VirtualKeyboard&amp;rdquo; that updates the on-screen keyboard for typing on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Android and provides better control.
According to the documentation, Virtual Keyboard (VK) is a public JavaScript API that puts control of the on-screen keyboard in the hands of Web developers. As it stands now, developers have very limited control over VK, and the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s performance is not ideal for scenarios where developers want users to use a website&amp;rsquo;s built-in keyboard to enter passwords on Android.</description>

As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>

      <description>JavaScript is single-threaded and asynchronous operations are particularly important.
Whenever you use functions outside the engine, you need to interact with the outside world, thus creating asynchronous operations. Because there are so many asynchronous operations, JavaScript has to provide a lot of asynchronous syntax. It&amp;rsquo;s like, some people get hit all the time, and they have to become very resilient, or they&amp;rsquo;re screwed.
Node&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous syntax is more complex than the browser&amp;rsquo;s, because it talks to the kernel and has to make a special library, libuv, to do this.</description>

They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>

      <description>Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format that can be used by any project in the Hadoop ecosystem.Parquet is language- and platform-agnostic.Parquet was originally developed and open-sourced in collaboration with Twitter and Cloudera, and graduated from Apache&amp;rsquo;s incubator as an Apache top-level project in May 2015 .
In the Spark project, Parquet is also its default data source. The default data source configuration can be modified via spark.sql.sources.default.
What is column-oriented Storage Format In a relational database, the practical use of columnar storage is little different from row storage.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Recently, the group created a new code repository to develop a new product, and since it&amp;rsquo;s raining hard in Beijing today, many of my colleagues chose to work from home (including me), so I chose to use my own PC to work.
But I used my own personal email address for the Git information on my PC.

This article introduces two common interfaces for inter-page interaction - window.postMessage and BroadcastChannel API - and compares the differences between them.
Messaging Direction window.postMessage An example of a window.postMessage call is as follows.

      <description>Nowadays, users&#39; requirements for front-end pages are no longer satisfied with achieving functionality, but also with value and fun. In addition to the overall UI aesthetics, adding the right animation effect in the right place is often more expressive and natural than static pages. For example, a simple loading animation or page switching effect can not only relieve the user&amp;rsquo;s waiting emotion, but even silently achieve the effect of brand</description>

      <description>Redis 6.0 has been released more than a year ago.
The new features in Redis 6.0 have been identified through step-by-step discussions and optimizations.
Many of these features have already been introduced in previous releases such as RC.
However, there are some new changes in the official GA release:
 SSL ACL: better, command support RESP3 Client side caching: redesigned Threaded I/O Diskless replication on replicas Cluster support in Redis-benchmark and improved redis-cli cluster support Disque in beta as a module of Redis: starting to invade the message queue space Redis Cluster Proxy Support for immediate deletion when the RDB is no longer in use, for scenarios where the disk is not dropped PSYNC2: Optimized replication protocol More friendly timeout setting support Faster RDB loading, 20% ~ 30% improvement STRALGO, new string command, currently only one implementation of LCS (longest common subsequence)  @antirez mentioned that it was only the largest version update in Redis history, so it was prudent to recommend more testing and evaluation of the product in the application, and promised to release version 6.</description>

      <description>SurfaceView is a special kind of view in Android. The biggest difference between it and TextView and Button is that it is not on the same view layer as its view container, and its UI display can be done in a separate thread, so the drawing of SurfaceView does not affect the main thread. surfaceView does not affect the main thread. Combining these features, SurfaceView is generally used to implement dynamic or complex images and animations.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-07/web-worker-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview The JavaScript language uses a single-threaded model, which means that all tasks can only be done on one thread, one thing at a time. If the previous task is not done, the later task has to wait. With the increase in computing power of computers, especially with the advent of multi-core CPUs, single-threading poses a great inconvenience and cannot fully utilize the computing power of computers.
The role of the Web Worker is to create a multi-threaded environment for JavaScript, allowing the main thread to create Worker threads and assign some tasks to the latter to run.</description>

      <description>The MySQL master-slave architecture has been widely used, and the stability of the master-slave replication relationship is a constant concern.
MySQL 5.6 provides a new feature for master-slave replication stability: slave support crash-safe. This feature can solve the problem of relay_log.info bit inaccuracy caused by abnormal power failure in previous versions.
In this article, we will introduce this feature in terms of principle, parameters, and new issues.

      <description>Starting with React 16.3, React deprecated some APIs (componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, and componentWillUpdate) and introduced some new ones instead, including getDerivedStateFromProps. getDerivedStateFromProps. Depending on the application scenario, getDerivedStateFromProps is used in different ways.
Semi-controlled components Although React officially does not recommend semi-controlled components, and certainly not from the perspective of API design and maintenance. However, in practice, users often don&amp;rsquo;t care about the internal implementation of a business logic, but want to have full control over some internal state when needed, so semi-controlled components are a good choice.</description>

      <description>The closing of SpringBoot applications is currently summarized in four ways. Rest api: use the spring-boot-starter-actuator module in the ShutdownEndpoint the exit static method of SpringApplication: just call the static method directly JMX: use the MXBean provided inside SpringBoot. use third-party process management tools Rest api The Rest api is exposed using Endpoint and requires the introduction of spring-boot-starter-actuator the stater. The corresponding Endpoint for this shutdown application is ShutdownEndpoint,</description>

      <description>This article reviews some of the uses of the select statement in the Go language and extends a tip on how to implement priority in select, which I hope will be helpful to you.
Introduction to the select statement The select statement in Go is used to monitor and select a set of case statements to execute the corresponding code. It looks similar to the switch statement, but all the expressions in the case in the select statement must be send or receive operations of the channel.</description>

      <description>Go reflect package provides the ability to get the type and value of an object at runtime, which can help us to abstract and simplify the code, achieve dynamic data acquisition and method invocation, improve development efficiency and readability, and make up for Go&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle data uniformly in the absence of generics.
With reflect, we can achieve the ability to get object types, object fields, object methods, get tag information of struct, dynamically create objects, whether objects implement specific interfaces, convert objects, get and set object values, call Select branches dynamically, etc.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to write JavaScript scripts to send user data back to the server.
I made a code repository containing all the examples below, which can be run to see the results.
1. Synchronization AJAX The common practice of sending data back to the server is to put the collected user data inside the unload event and send it back to the server with an AJAX request.
However, asynchronous AJAX inside the unload event may not always work, because the page is already in unload and the browser may or may not send it.</description>

      <description>Handling time is always a headache, no matter what time it is. The time format is too diverse, and it is even more difficult to deal with time zones, daylight saving time, leap seconds and other minor details. Therefore, we usually use standard libraries or time libraries provided by third parties to handle time in our programs. The dateparse we are going to introduce today focuses on a very small area of time processing - parsing strings in date time format.</description>

We know that with cloud services like AWS, it&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to connect to the cloud when developing locally, not to mention that the staging/production environment will have security considerations. So when we create a project, how do we build its local development environment to facilitate our local development and debugging? That&amp;rsquo;s right!</description>

Previously, many gateway applications used the Spring-Cloud-Netfilx solution based on the Zuul1.x version, but given that Zuul1.x had stopped iterating, it used a more traditional blocking</description>

      <description>This article summarizes the problems and solutions I usually encounter in my projects regarding the interconversion between go language JSON data and structs.
Basic Serialization First let&amp;rsquo;s look at the basic usage of json.Marshal() (serialization) and json.Unmarshal (deserialization) in the Go language.

      <description>Our project uses GitLab for code management, and when I upgraded the system to SpringBoot 2.0, the branch was merged to the Master branch. During the actual deployment, I found that a child dependency of a two-party package that I depended on had not been upgraded, causing a service to fail to drop through. Since it took time to fix the bipartite package, we decided to Revert the Master branch in order not to affect the subsequent release of other features.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a small knowledge point during development. Here is a Base64 encoded image that I want to copy into the system pasteboard, how can I solve this?
For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.
Q: Now I have an image in this format, how can I copy it into the system pasteboard?</description>

      <description>Spring provides the ApplicationContext event mechanism to publish and listen to events, which is a very useful feature. Spring has some built-in events and listeners, such as before the Spring container starts, after the Spring container starts, after the application fails to start, etc. The listeners on these events will respond accordingly. Of course, we can also customize our listeners to listen to Spring&amp;rsquo;s original events. Or we can customize</description>

      <description>The scope of GatewayFilter is the specified routing configuration, and the routing configuration options require filters to specify the list of GatewayFilters that you want to use. We can customize the GatewayFilter to do additional extensions to achieve some functionality that does not exist in the built-in GatewayFilter and apply it to our routing configuration.
How to customize GatewayFilter To customize GatewayFilter, you need to implement the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.GatewayFilterFactory interface, and the definition of GatewayFilterFactory is as follows.</description>

      <description>fetch() is an upgraded version of XMLHttpRequest used to make HTTP requests inside JavaScript scripts.
The browser provides this object natively. This article describes its usage in detail.
1. Basic usage The function of fetch() is basically the same as XMLHttpRequest, but with three main differences.
 fetch() uses Promise and does not use a callback function, so it is much simpler to write and more concise. The modular design of fetch(), with API spread over multiple objects (Response object, Request object, Headers object), is more reasonable; in contrast, the API design of XMLHttpRequest is not very good, with input, output and state all managed in the same interface, making it easy to write very confusing code.</description>

      <description>Back in 2015, the keynote at the SpringOne 2015 conference in Washington was Cloud Native Enterprise. The slogan of that conference was also Cloud Native and the posters were all over the place with Cloud Native.
You may wonder how you could call it Cloud Native when containers weren&amp;rsquo;t popular at that time. Although many people may not have the same understanding of Cloud Native, more and more people believe that &amp;ldquo;Cloud native is about culture, not containers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This article mainly analyzes the usage of Introspector. Introspector is a tool class that deals specifically with JavaBean and is used to get the descriptors in JavaBean. The commonly used descriptor-related classes of JavaBean are BeanInfo, PropertyDescriptor, MethodDescriptor, BeanDescriptor, EventSetDescriptor and ParameterDescriptor. The following will slowly analyze how these classes are used, as well as some of the features of Introspector.
What is JavaBean JavaBean is a special (actually, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to say ordinary, it&amp;rsquo;s not very special) class, mainly used to pass data information, the methods in this class are mainly used to access private fields, and the method names conform to some naming rules (fields are private, each field has Setter and Getter methods, methods and fields named to meet the first letter lower case hump naming ).</description>

      <description>In large applications, it is a common design pattern to configure master-slave databases and use read-write separation. In Spring applications, to implement read-write separation, it is best to not make changes to existing code, but to support it transparently at the bottom.
Spring has a built-in AbstractRoutingDataSource that can configure multiple data sources into a Map and then, depending on the key, return different data sources. Because AbstractRoutingDataSource is also a DataSource interface, the application can set the key first, and the code that accesses the database can get the corresponding real data source from AbstractRoutingDataSource to access the specified database.</description>

      <description>jsonpath is a tool used to parse json data, similar to xpath, jsonpath can parse very complex json data.
PostgreSQL json development history. postgreSQL has supported json data type since 9.2, but due to the poor performance of parsing json data, it is not favored by everyone, but choose to use nosql database instead. So from pg9.4 onwards, the jsonb data type was supported. Compared to the json type, jsonb does not need to be parsed every time it is used, so the performance is much improved, and it also supports index queries and so on.</description>

      <description>In real projects, when you need to do unit testing. But often you find that there are a lot of dependencies. That&amp;rsquo;s where Gomock comes in handy!
Gomock is an official mock framework for the Go language
Installation 1 2  $ go get -u github.com/golang/mock/gomock $ go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen     Step 1: We will install the gomock third-party library and the mock code generation tool, mockgen, which will save us a lot of work.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction rsync is a commonly used Linux application for file synchronization.
It can synchronize files between the local computer and a remote computer, or between two local directories (but does not support synchronization between two remote computers). It can also be used as a file copying tool, replacing the cp and mv commands.
The r in its name refers to remote, rsync actually means &amp;ldquo;remote synchronization&amp;rdquo;. Unlike other file transfer tools (such as FTP or scp), rsync&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it checks the existing files of both the sender and the receiver and only transfers the parts that have changed (the default rule is that the file size or modification time has changed).</description>

However, you can only choose to install one of the object cache programs, Redis and Memcached. For Litespeed/Wordpress systems, there is not much difference in performance between the two as object cache programs. Today we will cover how to install a Redis server.</description>

      <description>Go compiles programs that are perfect for deployment, and if no other libraries are referenced through CGO, we generally compile executable binaries that are single files, perfect for copying and deployment. In practice, in addition to binaries, you may also need some configuration files, or static files, such as html templates, static images, CSS, javascript, etc. How these files can also be typed into the binary would be fantastic, and we could just copy and follow the single executable.</description>

Previously I was passing the prop to the child component, and then the child component directly changed the prop directly, this can reflect the result to the parent component, but it is not a good solution.
For example, I often encounter this Warning.

Goroutine Leak The causes of Goroutine leaks are usually:
 Read/write operations such as channel/mutex are being performed inside Goroutine, but due to logic problems, they are blocked all the time in some cases. The business logic within the Goroutine enters a dead loop and resources are never released.</description>

      <description>Constants are arguably present in every code file, and there are many benefits to using them.
 Avoid magic literals, i.e. numbers, strings, etc. that appear directly in the code. It is not possible to read the code and see what it means at a glance. It also avoids the inconsistencies that can occur when using literals. When their values need to be modified, constants only need to be modified in one place, while literals need to be modified in multiple places, making it easy to miss inconsistencies.</description>

      <description>When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
JDBC batch execute When using JDBC, you can use Statement#addBatch(String sql) or PreparedStatement#addBatch method to add SQL statements to the batch list, and then execute them in batch with the executeBatch method. When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
reWriteBatchedInserts=true The PostgreSQL JDBC driver supports the reWriteBatchedInserts=true join parameter to modify multiple insert/update statements into a single statement, for example: insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;); insert into test(name) values (&#39;m&#39;); is modified to insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;), (&#39;m&#39;); .</description>

Previously, exception handling was to add err handling for each asynchronous function, which not only increased the workload, but also easily missed some exceptions. Fortunately, Angular6 provides ErrorHandler to handle exceptions (Ionic4 for IonicErrorHandler), the default ErrorHandler handling exceptions is to output it on the console, which obviously can not meet the demand, so you need to implement</description>

In general, scripts should not alter the user&amp;rsquo;s clipboard in a way that does not meet the user&amp;rsquo;s expectations. However, there are times when this is convenient, such as the &amp;ldquo;one-click copy&amp;rdquo; feature, where the user clicks a button and the specified content automatically goes to the clipboard.
Currently, there are three ways to implement clipboard operations.</description>

      <description>Redis stores key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values are of various types, such as string, list, hash, set, sorted set, and so on. When setting a key-value pair, we should also set the expiration time for it, which can be set by expire and pexpire commands, or by setnx command. So, after setting the expiration time, how exactly do you delete the expired key-value pairs? To find out, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Redis&#39; expired key deletion policy.</description>

      <description>There are two types of channels in Go language, a channel without cache and a buffer with cache, both of which we are familiar with.
Why am I suddenly talking about this infinite cache channel? The main reason is that I was recently reviewing a colleague&amp;rsquo;s code and I had a problem with a certain design idea that would have been solved by using an infinite cache channel.
 A dispatcher contains a channel, which holds the URLs to be processed A bunch of workers read tasks from the channel, download and parse the page, extract the links, and put the links into the dispatcher.</description>
