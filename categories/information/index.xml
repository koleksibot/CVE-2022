      <description>Microsoft confirmed that TPM 2.0 support is now required to run Windows on a virtual machine, which means that users can no longer install Windows 11 on an older, spare PC or laptop.
In the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22000.194 changelog, Microsoft clarified the requirements for running Windows 11 on a virtual machine, stating that the system requirements for Windows 11 on a virtual machine (VM) will be the same as a physical PC, and that VMs previously created to run the Insider Preview version will not be updated to the latest preview version.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-09/cpp-sort/</guid>
      <description>The sort method of std accepts two iterators, begin and end, and abstracts access to the elements through the iterators, hiding the internal implementation.
This is a simple example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  std::list&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; list { 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, }; std::sort(list.begin(), list.end());   The result is that the list is sorted, and we don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about what sorting algorithm is used.</description>

      <description>Tensorflow is a Python based machine learning and artificial intelligence project developed by Google. Recently TensorFlow has dropped support for YAML in order to fix a critical code execution vulnerability.
AML or YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language is a human-readable data serialization language used to pass objects and store data between processes and applications, and many Python applications use YAML to serialize and deserialize objects.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-37678, and the maintainers of TensorFlow and Keras, a wrapper project for TensorFlow, say that the vulnerability stems from an insecure parsing of YAML, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when an application deserializes a Keras model served in YAML format.</description>

      <description>I am temporarily unemployed, so this article does not represent the views of any employer.
By 2021, most companies have decided to embrace cloud-native, but many programmers&#39; understanding of cloud-native is limited to &amp;ldquo;native k8s-based applications&amp;rdquo;. If a company goes to the cloud (k8s), it&amp;rsquo;s embracing cloud-native. Those with a little more understanding think that if we go to service mesh in addition to k8s, we are embracing cloud-native.
The cncf&amp;rsquo;s definition of cloud-native is in fact very complex.</description>

It will now be necessary to use the encrypted Git protocol when pushing and pulling Git data. These changes will affect some of the keys supported in SSH, and according to the Git Systems team, unencrypted Git protocols will now be a thing of the past.
Specifically, GitHub no longer supports DSA keys (Digital Signature Algorithm), and some traditional SSH algorithms such as HMAC-SHA-1 and CBC are no longer available.</description>

      <description>Qt has published a blog post comparing Qt 6.2 LTS with Qt 5.15, stating that Qt 6.2 LTS will completely override Qt 5.15.
When Qt 6.0 debuted last year, most of the criticism came from the fact that it didn&amp;rsquo;t port all the modules and features from Qt5, and that Qt Inc. limited the Qt 5.15 LTS release to paying customers only. Since then, developers have been working to address these missing elements in Qt6, and with the upcoming Qt 6.</description>

Finally, an A/B test was carried out with users of the site to see if any new users liked the homepage, but the results were essentially 50/50.</description>

The official blog notes that Deno embraces modern Web APIs, and they believe that when features are added to runtime, it is best to do so in the form of Web APIs. This is both good for developers, who are already familiar with these APIs, and good for Deno, who can leverage existing tests.
The Web API has a huge amount of documentation, and a search for &amp;ldquo;fetch javascript&amp;rdquo; yields hundreds of millions of results.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s employees came out to start a business, the company name is also TailScale (seems to be doing vpn&amp;rsquo;s), PlanetScale (this seems to be taking vitess out to start a business) so that means ex-googler is also more like the culture of this company.</description>

      <description>Google recently released an end-to-end neural audio codec &amp;ndash; SoundStream. Most importantly, Google says this is the world&amp;rsquo;s first audio codec powered by a neural network and supporting different sound types such as voice, music and ambient sounds, which can process the above-mentioned kinds of audio in real time on a smartphone&amp;rsquo;s processor.
Audio codecs are essential tools for compressing audio files in order to make them smaller and save as much time as possible during transmission.</description>

      <description>Some users may only open a small number of pages that they currently need to use, while others may open all the tabs that they want to use now and may want to use later. In the latter case, the tabs are stacked together and inevitably closed by mistake, and the user may need to reopen it.
All browsers on the market today have an &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; option to restore closed tabs, which is only available in regular browsing windows, not in incognito or private browsing windows.</description>

      <description>If your Git actions have been failing or giving errors on GitHub since yesterday (August 14), it&amp;rsquo;s likely because you&amp;rsquo;re still using password-based authentication for your Git actions, and now you need to change that setting.
GitHub announced last July that it would no longer accept account passwords to authenticate Git operations, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to make that decision official. You will now need to use SSH keys or token-based authentication to authenticate Git operations.</description>

      <description>WireGuard author Jason Donenfeld recently announced the WireGuardNT project, a native port of WireGuard for the Windows kernel. Like the other versions, WireGuardNT, lowercase &amp;ldquo;wireguard-nt&amp;rdquo;, started out as a port of the Linux version of the codebase. After a successful initial porting effort, the NT codebase quickly diverged to better fit the native NTisms and NDIS (Windows Network Stack) APIs, and the end result was a deeply integrated and high-performance WireGuard implementation for the NT kernel that leverages the full functionality of the NT kernel and NDIS.</description>

As long as users have some observation of others around them, they will find that more and more users have switched to Chromium-based browsers instead of Firefox.
Recently, Firefox published its public data report since 2018, and the official report is a further confirmation of users&#39; observations.</description>

      <description>Microsoft and Google are working on a new API for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge called &amp;ldquo;VirtualKeyboard&amp;rdquo; that updates the on-screen keyboard for typing on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Android and provides better control.
According to the documentation, Virtual Keyboard (VK) is a public JavaScript API that puts control of the on-screen keyboard in the hands of Web developers. As it stands now, developers have very limited control over VK, and the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s performance is not ideal for scenarios where developers want users to use a website&amp;rsquo;s built-in keyboard to enter passwords on Android.</description>

As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Edge vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman revealed that the team is experimenting with a new feature in Edge that disables the JavaScript JIT compiler to enable some additional security protection. They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>
