This is actually a picture, although the content inside can not be copied, but the picture as a whole look very sophisticated, right? The three red, yellow and green buttons in the upper left corner are the window buttons in the Mac, and then the code highlighting color scheme is exactly the same as the color scheme in our IDE, the whole is a Mac style.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the development progress of the JDK concurrent library for a long time, but I was busy some time ago and rarely checked the official OpenJDK website.
The Java concurrent project Loom (because the project is still in the development stage, OpenJDK gives only a small amount of Loom project-related information in the official website https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom) has been established before 2018, and has been released based on JDK17 compilation and JDK18 compilation, etc.</description>

      <description>Safari browser does not support build-in custom elements, only anonymous custom elements.

      <description>In Local Development, sometimes we often need to emulate an https environment, for example, PWA applications that require https access. In the traditional solution, we need to use self-signed certificate, and then use self-signed certificate in http server. Since self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers, to solve the browser trust problem we need to add the CA certificate used by self-signed certificates to the trusted CA certificate of the</description>

      <description>What is babel? babel is a Javascript compiler, one of the most commonly used tools for front-end development today, primarily for converting ECMAScript 2015+ versions of code to backward-compatible JavaScript syntax so that it can run in current and older versions of browsers or other environments.

      <description>Web technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, but there is one area that has been impossible to break through &amp;mdash;- games.
The performance requirements for games are so high that some large games struggle to run even on a PC, let alone in the sandbox model of a browser! However, despite the difficulties, many developers have never given up and want to make browsers run 3D games.
In 2012, Alon Zakai, an engineer at Mozilla, was working on the LLVM compiler and had the idea that many 3D games are written in C/C++, so if we could compile C/C++ into JavaScript code, they would run in the browser.</description>

      <description>Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format that can be used by any project in the Hadoop ecosystem.Parquet is language- and platform-agnostic.Parquet was originally developed and open-sourced in collaboration with Twitter and Cloudera, and graduated from Apache&amp;rsquo;s incubator as an Apache top-level project in May 2015 .
In the Spark project, Parquet is also its default data source. The default data source configuration can be modified via spark.sql.sources.default.
What is column-oriented Storage Format In a relational database, the practical use of columnar storage is little different from row storage.</description>

      <description>The standard library provides std::env::args() to get command line arguments, the first value is the name of the program, similar to the way arguments are obtained in other languages:

      <description>Handling time is always a headache, no matter what time it is. The time format is too diverse, and it is even more difficult to deal with time zones, daylight saving time, leap seconds and other minor details. Therefore, we usually use standard libraries or time libraries provided by third parties to handle time in our programs. The dateparse we are going to introduce today focuses on a very small area of time processing - parsing strings in date time format.</description>

We know that with cloud services like AWS, it&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to connect to the cloud when developing locally, not to mention that the staging/production environment will have security considerations. So when we create a project, how do we build its local development environment to facilitate our local development and debugging? That&amp;rsquo;s right!</description>

      <description>Our project uses GitLab for code management, and when I upgraded the system to SpringBoot 2.0, the branch was merged to the Master branch. During the actual deployment, I found that a child dependency of a two-party package that I depended on had not been upgraded, causing a service to fail to drop through. Since it took time to fix the bipartite package, we decided to Revert the Master branch in order not to affect the subsequent release of other features.</description>

For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.

      <description>This article describes the &amp;ldquo;pitfalls&amp;rdquo; you need to know when converting struct to map[string]interface{} in Go, and also some of the methods you need to know.
We usually use struct in Go to store our data, for example, to store user information, we might define the following struct.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  // UserInfo type UserInfo struct { Name string `json:&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;` Age int `json:&amp;#34;age&amp;#34;` } u1 := UserInfo{Name: &amp;#34;q1mi&amp;#34;, Age: 18}   struct to map[string]interface JSON serialization method Serialize u1 with JSON, then deserialize to map</description>

      <description>Today we want to introduce a magic tool - Air can listen to the project&amp;rsquo;s code files in real time, and automatically recompile and execute the code after changes, greatly improving the development efficiency of gin framework projects.
Why do I need real-time loading When using Python to write Web projects, the common Flask or Django frameworks support live-loading, and after you modify the project code, the program can automatically reload and execute (live-reload), which is very convenient in the daily development phase.</description>

      <title>Rsync Usage Tutorial</title>

      <description>1. Introduction rsync is a commonly used Linux application for file synchronization.
It can synchronize files between the local computer and a remote computer, or between two local directories (but does not support synchronization between two remote computers). It can also be used as a file copying tool, replacing the cp and mv commands.
The r in its name refers to remote, rsync actually means &amp;ldquo;remote synchronization&amp;rdquo;. Unlike other file transfer tools (such as FTP or scp), rsync&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it checks the existing files of both the sender and the receiver and only transfers the parts that have changed (the default rule is that the file size or modification time has changed).</description>
