      <description>Back in 2015, the keynote at the SpringOne 2015 conference in Washington was Cloud Native Enterprise. The slogan of that conference was also Cloud Native and the posters were all over the place with Cloud Native.
You may wonder how you could call it Cloud Native when containers weren&amp;rsquo;t popular at that time. Although many people may not have the same understanding of Cloud Native, more and more people believe that &amp;ldquo;Cloud native is about culture, not containers&amp;rdquo;.</description>
