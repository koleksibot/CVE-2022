      <description>Unlike using JavaScript, writing Vue programs in Typescript requires an understanding of Vue-related types, most of which are written in the @vue/runtime-core package.
Component A Vue page is composed of a component, and the component&amp;rsquo;s class in Vue is Component, which inherits from ComponentOptions, FunctionalComponent and ComponentPublicInstanceConstructor.
Of these, ComponentOptions inherits from ComponentOptionsBase, which is the declarative options component we often write that contains properties such as data, methods, etc.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was writing the home page of deepincn, and I saw elementary os&#39; home page style was quite nice, so I planned to learn from it.
Originally intended to use Angular development, but see Vue3 has been very stable, so I plan to regain Vue3, using Vue3 to write the new home page.
In order to facilitate future data updates, you need to use centralized data management, Vue under the more famous and good is Vuex, and Vuex has also been adapted to Vue3, you can rest assured that the use of.</description>

      <description>The HTML &amp;lt;picture&amp;gt; element has been around for many years (it appeared in 2014), but it is rarely used, why? I have summarized the following 3 reasons. no one knows about it cumbersome to use it can be replaced This element is obviously very practical The HTML &amp;lt;picture&amp;gt; element is useful, and is often used in conjunction with the &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; element (which can be multiple) and the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; element (which</description>

      <description>In multi-page web applications, you will encounter scenarios of inter-page interaction, such as: passing data from navigation pages to iFrame pages, notifying events between tab pages, and so on.
This article introduces two common interfaces for inter-page interaction - window.postMessage and BroadcastChannel API - and compares the differences between them.
Messaging Direction window.postMessage An example of a window.postMessage call is as follows.

      <description>Redux is a data management layer that is widely used to manage data for complex applications. But in practice, Redux is poorly used, and arguably not well used. And at the same time, a number of data management solutions have emerged in the community, Mobx being one of them.

      <description>Nowadays, users&#39; requirements for front-end pages are no longer satisfied with achieving functionality, but also with value and fun. In addition to the overall UI aesthetics, adding the right animation effect in the right place is often more expressive and natural than static pages. For example, a simple loading animation or page switching effect can not only relieve the user&amp;rsquo;s waiting emotion, but even silently achieve the effect of brand</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-07/web-worker-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview The JavaScript language uses a single-threaded model, which means that all tasks can only be done on one thread, one thing at a time. If the previous task is not done, the later task has to wait. With the increase in computing power of computers, especially with the advent of multi-core CPUs, single-threading poses a great inconvenience and cannot fully utilize the computing power of computers.
The role of the Web Worker is to create a multi-threaded environment for JavaScript, allowing the main thread to create Worker threads and assign some tasks to the latter to run.</description>

Node comes with an npm module, so you can use the npx command directly. In case it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install it manually.

      <description>Components are the direction of front-end development, and the popular React and Vue are both component frameworks. Google has been pushing for native components for browsers due to its mastery of the Chrome browser, namely the Web Components API. Compared to third-party frameworks, native components are simple and straightforward, intuitive, don&amp;rsquo;t have to load any external modules, and have a small amount of code. It is still evolving, but is</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that React hooks are very useful and I&amp;rsquo;ve reacquainted myself with the React framework. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to understand hooks properly, and to analyze useEffect(), one of the most important hooks, in depth. The content will be as common as possible, so that friends who are not familiar with React can also read.

      <description>I recently came across a small knowledge point during development. Here is a Base64 encoded image that I want to copy into the system pasteboard, how can I solve this?
For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.
Q: Now I have an image in this format, how can I copy it into the system pasteboard?</description>

      <description>fetch() is an upgraded version of XMLHttpRequest used to make HTTP requests inside JavaScript scripts.
The browser provides this object natively. This article describes its usage in detail.
1. Basic usage The function of fetch() is basically the same as XMLHttpRequest, but with three main differences.
 fetch() uses Promise and does not use a callback function, so it is much simpler to write and more concise. The modular design of fetch(), with API spread over multiple objects (Response object, Request object, Headers object), is more reasonable; in contrast, the API design of XMLHttpRequest is not very good, with input, output and state all managed in the same interface, making it easy to write very confusing code.</description>

      <description>1. Vite brings the light It&amp;rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that Vite has brought an absolute revolution to the front-end.
Or we can say that the integration of esbuild, Browser es modules, HMR, Pre-Bundling, and other advanced tools and ideas about JS compilation development in the community behind Vite has brought about a revolutionary changes.
The main reason why Vite is faster is that esbuild does pre-bundles dependencies + browser native ESM dynamic compilation, which I won&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail here</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a problem, that is, how to implement two-way binding prop in Vue.js is better.
Previously I was passing the prop to the child component, and then the child component directly changed the prop directly, this can reflect the result to the parent component, but it is not a good solution.
For example, I often encounter this Warning.
 Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten…</description>

      <description>Exception handling is very important in front-end, including client-side and server-side exceptions. Previously, exception handling was to add err handling for each asynchronous function, which not only increased the workload, but also easily missed some exceptions. Fortunately, Angular6 provides ErrorHandler to handle exceptions (Ionic4 for IonicErrorHandler), the default ErrorHandler handling exceptions is to output it on the console, which obviously can not meet the demand, so you need to implement</description>

After some troubleshooting, we finally found that the old version of js file was packed locally, and the project itself depends on a different version, so we can delete the old version of the local file.
We can find out that RN has a version check at startup through this error, how is the specific mechanism, let&amp;rsquo;s follow the source code together.</description>

      <description>1, Introduction Browsers allow JavaScript scripts to read and write to the clipboard to automatically copy or paste content.
In general, scripts should not alter the user&amp;rsquo;s clipboard in a way that does not meet the user&amp;rsquo;s expectations. However, there are times when this is convenient, such as the &amp;ldquo;one-click copy&amp;rdquo; feature, where the user clicks a button and the specified content automatically goes to the clipboard.
Currently, there are three ways to implement clipboard operations.</description>
