      <description>Recently, user na-an discovered that when opening a folder with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VSCode editor, many empty files with invalid code are automatically created in the directory. The user then posted a related issue to the VSCode GitHub repository, which randomly sparked a lively discussion, with many users saying they were also suffering from the bug.
Some of the file names are short, some are long, and the names of these files are not valid unicode, for example \312\316\361 in the figure is octal.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones are carrying more and more features, and naturally users need more and more storage space. But for users with low-end phones, storage space is stretched to the limit, and they often need to uninstall apps that are already installed on their phones in order to install some new apps, thus freeing up space on their phones.
Google brought the feature of uninstalling unused apps to Android a few years ago, which prompts users to uninstall apps they haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a long time to free up space when the phone is running low.</description>

      <description>Recently, Twitter user Florian said: Microsoft has added some ads to the File Explorer in its Windows 11 Insider preview version.
As the screenshot shows, Microsoft uses such ads to promote other Microsoft products and &amp;ldquo;write confidently in documents, email and on the web with advanced writing suggestions from Microsoft Editor.
The old File Explorer was already a point of criticism for Windows, and Microsoft has worked hard to improve the ease of use and appearance of its default File Explorer, such as the recently added &amp;ldquo;tabs&amp;rdquo; feature that opens multiple folder tabs like a browser.</description>

      <description>Microsoft has put forward a new proposal to bring an optional type syntax to JavaScript, which could make JavaScript natively come with some of the features of TypeScript, making the TypeScript language faster and easier to use.
Specifically, the proposal calls for Type Annotations to be added to JavaScript code, allowing type annotations to be checked by external type checkers. At runtime, the JavaScript engine would ignore these annotations and treat these types as annotations.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is one of the most widely used computational tools for big data analytics today. It excels at batch and real-time stream processing and supports machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data analytics applications. The narrowly defined Hadoop (MR) technology stack is shrinking as Spark becomes more popular and more heavily used. In addition, general opinion and practical experience has proven that Hadoop (YARN) does not have the flexibility to integrate with a broader enterprise technology stack, except for Big Data-related workloads.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s self-developed Fuchsia operating system is now available as a full Chrome browser experience, a further step towards widespread deployment, according to tech media outlet 9to5Google.
Previously, users have had very limited access to the web on Fuchsia for some time now through the operating system&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Simple Browser&amp;rdquo; app (powered by the Chromium engine). But even so, the &amp;ldquo;browser&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t offer some of the daily necessities such as the address bar or tabs.</description>

      <title>New cgroups vulnerability in Linux kernel could elevate user privileges</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/linux-kernel-new-cgroups-vulnerability/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/linux-kernel-new-cgroups-vulnerability/</guid>
      <description>A new cgroups vulnerability, codenamed CVE-2022-0492, which could be abused to evade containers in order to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.
The vulnerability comes from a Linux kernel feature known as cgroups control group, cgroups allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups so that CPU, memory, and other resource usage, disk I/O, and networking can be limited and monitored.
However, because cgroups lacks internal validation of the release_agent file and fails to properly check whether the process setting the release_agent file has administrative privileges, an attacker can use this cgroups v1 release_agent feature to elevate privileges and accidentally bypass namespace isolation.</description>

      <description>The Go language community is discussing a new proposal called &amp;ldquo;arena&amp;rdquo;.
According to the proposal, &amp;ldquo;Go arena&amp;rdquo; is used to optimize memory allocation. arena is a method of allocating a set of memory objects from contiguous memory regions, with the advantage that allocating objects from arena is generally more efficient than general memory allocation. More importantly, objects in arena can be released all at once with minimal memory management or garbage collection overhead.</description>

      <description>In early 2008, Australian brothers Simon Zerner and Toby Zerner started the development of esoTalk. Unfortunately, esoTalk was still in Alpha phase when the lead developer brother Simon passed away in mid-2009.
It was his brother Toby who replaced Simon in maintaining and updating esoTalk.
In the README.md file, it says: &amp;ldquo;esoTalk was developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother Simon.&amp;rdquo; In the end, the two brothers left behind an open source forum system developed with PHP+MySQL, with very simple, fast and modern features.</description>

      <description>According to news on the Linux kernel mailing list, the community recently discussed whether to adopt the modern C language standard for the kernel.
While the Linux kernel is evolving rapidly, it also relies on some very old tools, one of which is that the kernel code is still using the 1989 version of the C language standard - a standard that was written more than 30 years ago before the kernel project was started.</description>

      <description>The incident started with a blog post by AWS a few days ago: &amp;ldquo;Sustainability with Rust&amp;rdquo;.
In this article, AWS compares Rust and Go as examples. AWS believes the reason for this is that Go is a garbage collection (GC) language, so when objects are created and released, the garbage collector needs to stop the program every once in a while and run a garbage collection. When the garbage collector is running, the process cannot respond to requests.</description>

Greg believes that a good error message should be self-explanatory and have three main points:
 what the user did. what acceptable inputs are. how to fix the problem.  Musk also commented on his opinion in this tweet, which he fully agrees with, and also said that compilers for programming languages could be better because not enough is currently being invested in them.</description>

      <description>Although TLS can encrypt the entire communication process, there are still many privacy-sensitive parameters that have to be transmitted in plaintext during the negotiation process, the most important and problematic of which is the domain name to be accessed, i.e. SNI (Server Name Indication). There is also the ALPN extension used to inform the client of the available application layer protocols, and compromising this could lead to an attacker knowing the services supported by the server and the purpose of the connection.</description>

      <description>Despite Opera&amp;rsquo;s diminishing presence in the market, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping Opera from being the first to &amp;ldquo;eat the crab&amp;rdquo; in the industry. Recently they announced that they will bring emoji-only URL support to the browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar, giving a new twist to what is currently a slightly bland address bar.
This new feature is a collaboration between Opera and Yat, a startup that sells emoji URLs, and through Yat users can make a one-time purchase and receive a unique domain name made up of emojis.</description>

      <description>Microsoft and North Carolina State University collaborated on an academic research project last year in which researchers found that thousands of JavaScript developers were using email addresses with expired domains as their npm accounts by analyzing the metadata of about 1.63 million libraries uploaded to Node Package Manager (npm), making it easy for their projects hosted on npm to be hijacked.
The email addresses of all users on npm are allegedly publicly available.</description>

      <description>Redis is a very popular in-memory database that allows for very high read and write performance by keeping data in memory. However, once a process exits, all of Redis&#39; data is lost. To solve this problem, Redis provides two persistence schemes, RDB and AOF, to save data in memory to disk and avoid data loss. In this article, we will focus on the AOF persistence scheme, some of its problems,</description>

      <description>What would the world be like without Linux?
More than twenty years ago, Linus Torvalds, the father of Linux, said, &amp;ldquo;If 386BSD had been available before I created Linux, then Linux might not have been born.&amp;rdquo;
Later, when people look back and reflect, there is no shortage of people who think: &amp;ldquo;If Linux had not flourished, FreeBSD would have filled the void today.&amp;rdquo;
BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, also known as Berkeley Unix), the most inextricable offshoot of Unix, had its cradle at the University of California, Berkeley, the most radical leftist stronghold in the United States at the time.</description>

Specifically, they are developing a new API that will allow games to communicate their current state to the OS. If the game takes time to load, the OS will send a command; the CPU will then run at a higher frequency, thus reducing the game load time.</description>

      <title>cURL will natively support JSON</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/curl-json/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/curl-json/</guid>
      <description>cURL author Daniel Stenberg emailed revealed about plans to add native support for JSON to cURL.
Daniel explains the reasons for adding native JSON support to cURL:
 sending JSON is a common practice in areas such as REST APIs &amp;ldquo;Ease of use with JSON&amp;rdquo; was a common consideration when many people were asked about choosing a cURL alternative on sites like Stack Overflow, a significant number of people were unable to send the correct JSON and quote JSON correctly using cURL because JSON uses double quotes and the Shell does not expand variables inside single quotes  Daniel also said that since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t send JSON very often, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate to rely entirely on him to design this feature.</description>

If for some reason users do not want these search engines in their browser, they can remove them from the settings.
However, in a recent update to Chromium 97, Chromium has changed these settings and the option to &amp;lsquo;remove&amp;rsquo; these default search engines no longer exists.</description>
