      <description>Maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of what ReCAPTCHA is, probably for some reason this CAPTCHA doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear much in China, but I think you should have seen or used it more or less. It looks like this. At this point, as soon as we click the checkbox at the top, the CAPTCHA algorithm will first use its &amp;ldquo;risk analysis engine&amp;rdquo; to do a security check, and if it passes the test</description>

      <description>Be cautious of popular technologies that promise to make work easy - they often cut corners, and security is often one of them.
A few days ago, the database of NewsBlur (a web-based RSS reader) was deleted by a hacker due to a bug that existed in Docker for years.
In a blog post this week, NewsBlur founder Samuel Clay detailed his ordeal: during a migration of a MongoDB cluster to a Docker container, a hacker gained access to the NewsBlur database, deleted 250GB of raw data, and demanded a 0.</description>

      <description>Recently, we have been particularly disturbed by various security vulnerabilities, and we have received dozens of vulnerability emails scanned by the security team in a week, which have a class of vulnerabilities that are easy to ignore, but have an extremely wide impact and are extremely harmful, and you should not be unfamiliar with my name, which is Spring Boot Actuator.
Before writing this article, I did a little survey with my friends asking them about their knowledge of the Spring Boot Actuator and the results were surprisingly consistent, everyone knows that Spring Boot provides automatic configuration of the spring-boot-starter-actuator, but very few people but few people actually use its related features.</description>

      <description>Because of the email-based identity verification feature of Git, you can easily fake being someone else to make a Commit. How do you ensure that the Commit is really a developer commit? This is where a special key, the GPG key, is needed for authentication.
About GPG GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a cryptographic software for encrypting and signing communication content and managing keys for asymmetric cryptography.
Asymmetric cryptography is a technique that you should have come across, and it is used in many fields.</description>
