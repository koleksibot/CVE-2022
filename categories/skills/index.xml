      <description>CookieStore API Currently, browsers can store cookie/sessionStorage/localStorage/IndexedDB, all of which expose a very developer friendly API, except for cookies. Think back to how we normally manipulate cookies. For example, if you want to retrieve a cookie, you have to parse it manually to get the value of a cookie because document.cookie returns a string that is the union of all cookies. If you want to add a cookie, then you</description>

      <title>The difference between Ctrl&#43;C and Kill to kill a process</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/different-from-ctrl-c-and-kill/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/different-from-ctrl-c-and-kill/</guid>
      <description>On linux systems, you can kill processes by typing &amp;lt;Ctrl+C&amp;gt; in bash or by using the command kill -9 $pid, but they are very different.
Let&amp;rsquo;s put the conclusion first: kill command will only kill the target process, while bash shortcut will kill the whole foreground process group!
linux process killing methods Regardless of the method used, killing processes is done by sending a signal. The kill command actually sends a signal to the target pid process.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to use ffmpeg to stitch a large number of images into a video, and introduces the meaning of some of the parameters. Before using ffmpeg to stitch images into a video, you need to pre-process the image file name, the file name must have a number to mark out its order, here I directly renamed the image using numbers, as follows. Directly use the command ffmpeg</description>

      <description>1. Introduction I believe there is no one who has not used P2P technology. BT seeds and magnetic links are the most common P2P technologies. With P2P technology, files are no longer stored centrally on one server, but are distributed among users&#39; nodes, each of which is a provider and a user of the service. Such a system has high availability, so that the whole service will not be unavailable due to the downtime of one or two machines.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/network-digital-authentication/</guid>
      <description>This article mainly wants to talk about one topic - authentication. That is, how to confirm that this data is sent by this person?
User Password To solve this problem, let&amp;rsquo;s look at one of the simplest solutions - the use of passwords. Usually, to prove a person&amp;rsquo;s identity on the Internet, something private and unique about that person is needed. For example, in many places, if you provide your user name + password, you can be sure that the person is you (note: password management, strong password settings, password leaks, password cracking and password cajoling are not in this article), that is, the password is a very private matter, we can assume that only one person in the world knows this matter, so We can assume that only one person in the world can know the password, so that when the person has provided the correct password, we can authenticate the person.</description>

      <title>TCP-based application layer protocol design</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/application-layer-protocol/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/application-layer-protocol/</guid>
      <description>Many people, including myself, have long believed that TCP-based application layer protocols are simple and only require a packet header. Because TCP is a reliable protocol, it ensures that data reaches the other side in an orderly and error-free manner; it is just stream-oriented and does not preserve message boundaries, so we only need to define protocol packet headers that can distinguish individual datagrams. However, this is wrong: the transport layer protocol is limited in what it can do, and the application layer protocol can do much more than encapsulate a packet header.</description>

      <description>String matching is a very common algorithm. What it does is, for the pattern string t, find the first occurrence of it in the target string s. For example, if t = &amp;quot;abcab&amp;quot;, s = &amp;quot;ababcabd&amp;quot;, the algorithm should return 2. Talking about string matching, we have to mention the KMP algorithm. KMP is a very powerful algorithm, which is very clever and can match strings in linear time complexity.</description>

      <description>Helps you distinguish between encodeURI and encodeURIComponent usage scenarios
Background Recently, while working on the preview feature in my company, I came across a scenario of encoding the request parameters. So the question arises.
 Why is it necessary to encode a link or parameter? When do I need to encode? What is the difference between * encodeURI and encodeURIComponent?  Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at it together~
Why do you need to encode Http protocol parameter transmission is &amp;ldquo;key=value&amp;rdquo; such key-value pairs, if you want to pass more than one parameter you need to use the &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; symbol to split the key-value pairs.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that almost everyone loves unity, and having a unified development experience is something that developers have always strived for and welcomed.
Development environments have long been tightly coupled with specific technologies, such as Visual Studio, for primarily .NET-based development. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen heated debates among developers who endlessly argue for one tool over another. This will never end, nor should it, because many times these arguments result in the awesome tools we are using today.</description>

      <description>When docker mounts the disk, as many containers use root to run programs inside the container, it will cause the files generated in the mount belong to root:root. generally the user outside the container is not root, which will make file sharing or even reading logs unnecessary trouble. This article aims to solve the problem of generating root privileged files from the root without changing the container.
The files generated by docker often need to be accessed by sudo chmod o+rw *, which is troublesome, but at least you have sudo privileges.</description>

      <description>Introduction This blog is about the four type conversions in C++: static_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, their usage and some usage scenarios.
static_cast The reference scenario of static_cast compares conversions, according to CppReference, to perform static type conversions from the expression e to T in the following cases.
Common types  for the expression e can be converted from an implicit type to T If a standard conversion sequence exists for types from T to e, a static type conversion can perform the inverse of that implicit type conversion sequence.</description>

      <description>Introduction Smart pointers are mainly used to automate the management of resources. There are std::unqiue_ptr, std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr according to their usage.
unique_ptr unique_ptr is mainly used to implement exclusive management of a resource object whose life cycle will end at the end of the unique_ptr declaration cycle or when it is pointed to another resource. A resource managed by unique_ptr can be transferred to another unqiue_ptr via std::move.
The following are some simple examples.</description>

      <description>Introduction In autonomous driving, there are several coordinate systems involved from the car&amp;rsquo;s sensors to global positioning, which are briefly organized below.
Sensor Coordinate System Each sensor has its own coordinate system, which can be divided into relative measurement (measuring environmental information) and absolute measurement (measuring its own information) according to its measurement principle. Relative sensors such as cameras and LiDAR measure environmental information for indirect positioning, while absolute sensors such as IMUs, tachometers, and GPS measure their own motion (speed, position, attitude, etc.</description>

      <description>Advertising attribution methods To discuss ad cheating, you need to understand the logic of ad attribution first. Cheating methods are basically based around the logic of ad attribution. There are various ad attribution schemes, we will mainly discuss here application-based advertising, overseas mobile ecology, and third-party attribution schemes. Overseas mobile advertising ecology has more mature and credible third-party attribution platforms, such as Appflyer, Adjust and Kochava, etc. The core logic of attribution is that the final attribution logic is the same as the final attribution logic.</description>

      <description>GraphQL is both a query language for the API and a runtime for your data queries. GraphQL provides a complete set of easy-to-understand descriptions of the data in your API, allowing the client to get exactly the data it needs without any redundancy, and making it easier for the API to evolve over time, as well as for building powerful developer tools.
 Over the last decade, REST has become the design standard for Web APIs, providing some great ideas such as stateless servers and structured access to resources.</description>

      <description>fs::symlink_metadata Recently I wrote a program to recursively search for folder statistics and got stuck when measuring the size of a folder I used find -type l to search for soft links and found two links referenced recursively: a points to b&amp;rsquo;s folder while b points to a&amp;rsquo;s folder Looking at the source code, I realized that the underlying std::fs::metadata call stat() system call would follow the link I switched</description>

      <description>Suppose there is a requirement that the Rust binary compiled in a fedora high version (2.34) glibc environment should be used in the customer&amp;rsquo;s centos7 glibc 2.17 environment, because the files compiled by the high version glibc will not work in the low version glibc environment
A possible solution is that the musl-gcc/musl-clang compiler makes the binary not strongly dependent on the glibc version, e.g. TabNine&amp;rsquo;s binary on Linux is musl&amp;rsquo;s</description>

      <description>Recently, I encountered some bugs in my project: the receiver of tokio channel was dropped for some reason, resulting in a send error.
After debugging, I found that it was actually caused by hyper&amp;rsquo;s cancel propagation. The following changes to examples/web_api.rs in the hyper source code can be reproduced

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/why-you-should-reject-racy-code/</guid>
      <description>In any language concurrent programming scenario, there is a race problem. Modern languages have two ideas to solve the race problem, one is to restrict the user from writing race code as much as possible by ownership+Sync/Send like rust, and one is to check for data contention during testing by race detector like Go.
The design of Go&amp;rsquo;s race detector means that it can&amp;rsquo;t be turned on in an online environment, and many companies don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a race test before they go live, which leads some Gophers to think that it&amp;rsquo;s okay if I write race code because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;eventually consistent&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Auth2.0 Protocol Introduction Regarding the application system user identity management requirements, including authentication, permission authorization, single sign-on, federated authentication and other business scenarios, there are a bunch of standards and specifications in the industry, such as CAS and Kerberos for single sign-on, OpenID for third-party authentication, OAuth for third-party user authorization, SAML for federated authentication and authorization data standards, and so on. Each technology has its own application scenarios and there are also crossover scenarios.</description>

      <description>According to the description of the Go generalization proposal, Go does not support generalized methods:No parameterized methods. The main reason Go generic processing is implemented at compile time, and generic methods are difficult to determine how the generic scheme should be instantiated without contextual analysis and inference at compile time, or even impossible to determine, resulting in the current (Go 1.18) Go implementation not supporting generic schemes. However, the lack</description>

      <description>The software world is evolving faster than ever, and the need to stay competitive requires new software releases as quickly as possible, without impacting users online. Many enterprises have migrated their workloads to Kubernetes clusters, which inherently take into account some production environment practices, but there are some additional things we need to do to make Kubernetes truly zero downtime without disruption or lost requests.
Rolling Updates By default, Kubernetes Deployment has a rolling update policy for Pod updates, which ensures that some instances are still running when the application is updated at any point in time to prevent the application from going down, and only kills the old Pod when the newly deployed Pod is up and ready to handle traffic.</description>

      <description>What is RESTful API? REST: The full name is Resource Representational State Transfer, or Representational Layer State Transfer. Look at the concept, I guess no one can understand. Explain in a human word: URL to locate resources, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to describe the operation.
Resources
A &amp;ldquo;resource&amp;rdquo; is an entity on the Web, or a specific piece of information on the Web. It can be a piece of text, a picture, a song, a service, in short, a concrete reality.</description>

So I came up with DropBox.
However, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply put the project in the DropBox directory, because that would cause every simple save to initiate a file sync, and some temporary file changes during compilation would cause the DropBox to sync, which would drive the CPU usage of the computer very high.</description>

      <description>Normally, when a client in the cluster connects to the service, the Pod supporting the service can get the IP address of the client, but when the connection is received through the node port, the source IP address of the packet will change because of the Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) performed on the packet, and the Pod on the backend cannot see the actual client IP, which is a problem for some applications, for example, the request log of nginx cannot get the exact IP of the client access.</description>

      <description>Okteto is an application development tool for developing and testing code in Kubernetes. It is very easy to launch a development environment in Kubernetes with one click through Okteto. We have also introduced the Skaffold tool from Google, and today we will demonstrate how to use Okteto to build Python application development environment.
Installation We just need to install the Okteto CLI tool on our local development machine. To use Okteto to configure the environment we need to have access to a Kubernetes cluster on our local machine, so The prerequisite is to configure a kubeconfig file for an accessible Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>

      <description>For a production environment and an aspiring ops person, even millisecond level downtime is not tolerated. Proper logging and monitoring of infrastructure and applications is very helpful in solving problems, and can also help optimize costs and resources, as well as help detect some problems that may occur later. In this article we will use the more lightweight Grafana Loki to implement log monitoring and alerting. The key thing is that if you are familiar with using Prometheus, you will have no problem using Loki, as they are basically the same, and have the same Label tag if they are auto-discovered in a Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to build a Kubernetes cluster using WSL2 and KinD under Windows 10. Over the past few years, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard in container orchestration. While there are now a variety of Kubernetes distributions and installers to deploy Kubernetes environments, we still need to deploy and run Kubernetes clusters locally, especially for developers, except in cloud or bare-metal environments.

      <description>KinD is a very lightweight Kubernetes installation tool that treats Docker containers as Kubernetes nodes, making it very easy to use. Since you can run a Kubernetes cluster in a Docker container, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to wonder if you can run it in a Pod. What are the problems with running in a Pod?
Installing Docker Daemon in a Pod KinD is now dependent on Docker, so first we need to create an image that allows us to run Docker Deamon in the Pod, so that we can execute commands like docker run inside the Pod, but this is not the same as the DIND mode of mounting docker.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about GitOps practices before, and we know that GitOps advocates managing all of your configuration through Git and versioning your environment configuration and infrastructure through declarative code.
In Kubernetes, we know that you can use resource manifest files to manage a cluster&amp;rsquo;s resource objects, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to store Kubernetes Secrets data in a Git repository, which is also very insecure.
Kubernetes Secrets are resource objects used to help us store sensitive information, such as passwords, keys, certificates, OAuth Token, SSH KEY, etc.</description>

      <description>The specific issue to be analyzed today is &amp;lsquo;why DNS uses the UDP protocol&amp;rsquo;. DNS acts as a phone book for the entire Internet, translating domain names that can be understood by humans into IP addresses that can be understood by machines, eliminating the need for users of the Internet to have direct access to IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand.
I believe that it is common knowledge among software engineers that DNS uses the UDP protocol, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS uses the UDP protocol to transfer data, but this is not entirely true.</description>

      <description>The two transport protocols, UDP and TCP, are core members of the IP protocol cluster. The RFC 768, published in 1980, defines the UDP protocol, which allows us to pass data across a network of multiple computer connections. The common DNS protocol can use the UDP protocol to obtain the results of domain name resolution
UDP is the simplest protocol that can transmit data, and its protocol header (also called protocol header) is only 8 bytes.</description>

      <description>Arrays and slices are common data structures in the Go language, and many developers new to Go tend to confuse these two concepts. In addition to arrays, Go introduces another concept - slicing. Slicing has some similarities to arrays, but their differences lead to significant differences in usage. In this section we will introduce the underlying implementation of arrays from the Go compile-time runtime, which will include several common operations for initializing, accessing, and assigning values to arrays.</description>

      <description>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has become the most commonly used application layer protocol on the Internet, however, it is only a network protocol for transmitting hypertext and does not provide any security guarantees, using plaintext to transmit packets over the Internet makes eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks possible. Transmitting passwords over HTTP is actually similar to running around naked on the Internet.
Netscape designed the HTTPS protocol in 1994 to secure data transfers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and with the development of Transport Layer Security (TLS), we now use TLS instead of the deprecated SSL protocol, although the term SSL certificate is still used.</description>

      <description>The TCP/IP protocol cluster establishes a conceptual model for communication protocols in the Internet, and the two main protocols in the cluster are TCP and IP. TCP in the TCP/IP protocol cluster guarantees the reliability and order of data segments, and with a reliable transport layer protocol, application layer protocols can directly use TCP to transfer data without the need to care about Loss and duplication of data segments
The IP protocol solves the routing and transmission of packets, and the upper layer TCP protocol is no longer concerned with routing and addressing.</description>

      <description>The TCP protocol contains 11 different states, and the TCP connection transitions states based on the messages sent or received. The state machine shown below illustrates all possible transitions, including not only the state transition process under normal conditions, but also the state transition under abnormal conditions.
Both parties communicating using the TCP protocol will trigger the TIME_WAIT state when closing the connection. The operation of closing the connection actually tells the other party to the communication that it has no data to send, but it still maintains the ability to receive data from the other party, a common process of closing the connection is as follows.</description>

      <description>You should be careful about setting the CPU limit for loads in k8s. A value that is too small can introduce extra, meaningless latency into your program, and a value that is too large can introduce too large a blast radius and weaken the overall stability of the cluster.
request and limit One of the major benefits of k8s is resource isolation. By setting the request and limit of the load, we can easily allow different programs to coexist on the right node.</description>

      <description>In almost all modern programming languages, the garbage collector is a complex system that requires a lot of effort in order to reclaim the deprecated memory without affecting the user program. Java&amp;rsquo;s garbage collection mechanism is a good example. Java 8 contains four garbage collectors, linear, concurrent, parallel marker removal, and G1. It takes a lot of effort to understand how they work and the details of their implementation. In</description>

      <description>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is today&amp;rsquo;s most widely used application layer protocol, drafted by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989, and has become the core of data transfer on the Internet. Over the past few years, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 have also updated the existing protocol to provide more secure and faster transfers. The existing protocols have been updated to provide more secure and faster transfers. Most programming languages implement HTTP/1.</description>

      <description>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format1, holds almost a majority of the market share today. Although it lacks serialization and deserialization performance compared to more compact data interchange formats, JSON offers good readability and ease of use, and it is a very good choice for using JSON as a serialization format when extreme mechanical performance is not sought.
Design Principles Almost all modern programming languages incorporate functions for handling JSON directly into the standard library, and the Go language is no exception.</description>

      <description>Developers familiar with the Go language are generally very familiar with the principles of Goroutine and Channel, including how to design applications based on the CSP model, but the Go language&amp;rsquo;s plug-in system is a module that few people know about. With the plug-in system, we can load dynamic libraries at runtime to implement some of the more interesting features.
Design Principles The plug-in system of Go language is implemented based on C dynamic libraries, so it also inherits the advantages and disadvantages of C dynamic libraries.</description>

      <description>CPU and Main memory are scarce resources in an operating system. All processes running in the current operating system share the CPU and memory resources in the system, and the operating system uses CPU scheduler to allocate CPU time and introduces virtual memory system to manage physical memory.
Before we can answer the need for virtual memory, we need to understand what virtual memory is in an operating system and what role it plays in the operating system.</description>

      <description>When we work with relational databases, the primary key is a concept that cannot be avoided. The primary key acts as an identifier for a record, and we can locate a unique record in a table by its identifier.
In a relational database, we choose the smallest subset of multiple fields in a record as the unique identifier for that record in the table. Depending on the definition of a primary key in a relational database, we can choose either a single column as the primary key or multiple columns as the primary key, but the primary key must exist and be unique throughout the record.</description>

      <description>The network layer protocol assumes the two major functions of packet forwarding and routing, and it can provide the upper layer with the responsibility of transporting packets between different hosts. IP protocol, as a network layer protocol, plays an extremely critical role in today&amp;rsquo;s Internet, although it can only provide connectionless and unreliable services.
In general, when we want to access services provided by other hosts, we need to access the target host through an IP address, which is the only way to be accessed by other hosts on the Internet.</description>

      <description>Engineers who know a little about computer networks or Kubernetes networks should have heard of Overlay Network, which is not a new technology, but a computer network built on top of another network, a form of network virtualization technology, which has been promoted by the evolution of cloud computing virtualization technology in recent years.
Because the Overlay network is a virtual network built on top of another computer network, it cannot stand alone, and the network on which the Overlay layer depends is the Underlay network, and the two concepts often appear in pairs.</description>

      <description>A system call is a way for a computer program to request services from the operating system kernel during execution. This may include hardware-related services, the creation and execution of new processes, and process scheduling. Anyone with a little knowledge of operating systems knows that - system calls provide the user program with an interface to the operating system.
The famous glibc for C language encapsulates the system calls provided by the operating system and provides a well-defined interface that allows engineers to develop upper-level applications directly using the functions encapsulated in the container.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-linux-default-page/</guid>
      <description>We all know that Linux manages memory in pages. Whether it is loading data from disk into memory or writing data from memory back to disk, the operating system operates in pages. Even if we write only one byte of data to disk, we need to swipe the entire data from the entire page to disk.
Linux supports both normal-sized memory pages and large memory pages (Huge Page). The default size of memory pages on most processors is 4KB, and although some processors use 8KB, 16KB, or 64KB as the default page size, 4KB pages are still the mainstream of the default memory page configuration of the operating system; in addition to the normal memory page size, different processors also contain large pages of different sizes.</description>

      <description>When we want to store data persistently, using relational databases is often the safest choice, not only because of the richness and stability of today&amp;rsquo;s relational databases, but also because the support for relational databases in different communities is very complete. In this article, we will analyze an important concept in relational databases - Foreign Key.
In a relational database, a foreign key, also known as a relational key, is a set of columns that provide a connection between relational tables in a relational database.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/whys-the-design-numa-performance/</guid>
      <description>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer memory design approach, as opposed to Uniform Memory Access (UMA), also known as Symmetric Multi-Processor Architecture (SMP), which was used by early computers, but most modern computers use NUMA architecture to manage CPU and memory resources.
As application developers, we are less likely to need direct access to hardware because the operating system shields us from many hardware-level implementation details. However, because NUMA affects applications, NUMA is something we must understand and be familiar with if we want to write high-performance, low-latency services, and this article will cover its impact in two ways.</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows a little bit about Linux knows that Linux divides the physical Random Access Memory (RAM) into 4KB-sized memory blocks by page, and the Swapping mechanism we are going to introduce today is closely related to memory, which is the process of the operating system copying the contents of physical memory pages to the swap space on the hard disk to release the memory. The physical memory and the swap partition on the hard disk make up the virtual memory available on the operating system, and these swap spaces are pre-configured by the system administrator.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we would like to present a paper from the 2018 ATC Journal &amp;ndash; NanoLog: A Nanosecond Scale Logging System, which implements NanoLog, a high-performance logging system that can perform 1 ~ 2 orders of magnitude better than other logging systems in the C++ community, e.g., spdlog, glog, and Boost Log. In this article, we will briefly analyze the design and implementation principles of NanoLog.
Logging is an important part of system observability, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many engineers have had the experience of adding logs on the fly to check for problems, a process the author has just re-visited.</description>

      <description>ClickHouse is one of the more popular online analytical processing (OLAP) data stores recently. Compared to our common traditional relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, data stores such as ClickHouse, Hive and HBase for online analytical processing (OLAP) scenarios tend to use columnar storage.
Readers who know a little about databases know that Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) are the two most common scenarios of databases, and these two scenarios are not the only two, from which there are also concepts derived from Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP).</description>

      <description>Disk for persistent storage is not a scarce resource today, but CPU and memory are still relatively expensive resources, and this article will describe how memory, a scarce resource in computers, is managed.
Memory management systems and modules play an important role in operating systems and programming languages. The use of any resource is inseparable from the two actions of requesting and releasing, and two important processes in memory management are memory allocation and garbage collection, and how a memory management system can use limited memory resources to provide services to as many programs or modules as possible is its core goal.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and Docker has played a pivotal role in containers from its inception to today, and is the default container engine in Kubernetes. However, in December 2020, the Kubernetes community decided to move forward with removing Dockershim-related code from its repositories, which was significant for both the Kubernetes and Docker communities.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure most developers have heard of Kubernetes and Docker and know that we can use Kubernetes to manage Docker containers, but they may not have heard of Dockershim, the Docker shim.</description>

      <description>This paper presents a paper from the 2011 NSDI journal &amp;ndash; Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center, which implements Mesos to manage different computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI, in a cluster. Although the Mesos cluster management system is a technology that was released more than 10 years ago and has been gradually replaced today by the more mainstream and general container orchestration system Kubernetes, it does solve some of the cluster management problems.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a very complex cluster orchestration system, yet even though it contains rich functionality and features, it cannot meet the needs of all scenarios because of the inherent high complexity of container scheduling and management. While Kubernetes can solve most of the common problems in most scenarios, in order to achieve a more flexible strategy, we need to use the scalability provided by Kubernetes for specific purposes.
Each project will focus on different features at different cycles, and we can simply divide the evolution of the project into three distinct phases.</description>

      <description>This paper is about the paper in the 2020 NSDI Journal &amp;ndash; Firecracker: Lightweight Virtualization for Serverless Applications, which implements Firecracker to provide lightweight virtualization support on the host. Many developers today choose to use Serverless containers and services to reduce system overhead, improve hardware resource utilization, and enable rapid scaling, but the Serverless scenario places higher demands on container isolation, security, and performance.
When serving multiple tenants with the same hardware, we expect the different workloads to be isolated for security and performance with minimal additional overhead.</description>

      <description>I remember a dozen years ago when I was still using the early Windows system, every time the system would become very laggy, then you need to open the system provides the following disk defragmentation program, when the defragmentation is complete will feel the system becomes slightly smoother some.
In the file system, defragmentation is the process of reducing fragmentation in the file system, which rearranges the contents of the same files on the disk in order and uses compression algorithms to remove gaps between files, somewhat similar to the tag compression algorithm in garbage collection.</description>

      <description>The pattern of development of most things in the world is similar. In the beginning, relatively general solutions tend to appear to solve most problems, followed by solutions specifically designed for a certain scenario that do not solve general problems but perform extremely well in some specific areas. In the field of computing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are general-purpose and specific solutions, respectively, with the former providing the most basic computing power to solve almost any problem, and the latter excelling in areas such as graphics computing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Why Linux and macOS don&#39;t need defragmentation</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/whys-the-design-linux-macos-fragmentation/</guid>
      <description>I believe that many software engineers today use Linux or macOS systems, and unlike Windows, we hardly see the concept of disk defragmentation. From personal experience, the author has not defragmented a disk in macOS for the past seven or eight years, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any related operations in today&amp;rsquo;s disk tools, only the diskutil command to set whether a disk is defragmented on or off.
Windows operating systems may need to defragment their disks every once in a while, and there are two reasons behind this problem: one is that Windows uses a very simple file system called FAT, which is designed in such a way that the same files may be scattered in different locations on the disk, and the other is that solid state drives were not popular in the ancient times and mechanical hard drives have poor random read and write performance.</description>

      <description>Swap in Linux is similar to virtual memory in Windows, which means that when there is a shortage of memory, a portion of the hard disk space can be used as virtual memory, thus solving the problem of insufficient memory capacity.
When installing a Linux system you need to set up a separate swap partition while Windows installation does not have this requirement, mainly because of the different ways of implementation.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes, released in 2014, has become the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure developers who talk about Kubernetes will repeat the above phenomenon over and over again. As the chart below shows, most individuals or teams today choose Kubernetes to manage containers, and 75% of people use Kubernetes in production environments.
In this context of universal learning and use of Kubernetes, it is also important to be very clear about what the limitations of Kubernetes are.</description>

      <description>When you think of Redis, you think of Memcached, and vice versa. Those who know both have a general impression that Redis supports simple key-value data types compared to Memcached, and also provides storage for data structures such as list, set, zset, and hash; redis supports data backup, redis supports data persistence, and it looks like redis is more powerful than memcached. The redis support for data backup, redis support for data persistence, looks redis than memcached more awesome, so in fact is this not the case?</description>

If we consider database as a warehouse, there are many rooms in the warehouse (schema), a schema represents a room, table can be seen as a locker in each room, user is the owner of each schema, has the right to operate each room in the database, that is to say, each database mapping user has the key to each schema (room).</description>

What is TokuDB? The most popular MySQL engine that supports full transactions is INNODB, which is characterized by the fact that the data itself is organized by B-TREE, which is a huge B-TREE index clustered by primary key. So at this point, the write speed will be somewhat reduced, because to write each time to use an IO to do the index tree rearrangement.</description>

      <description>In computer science, fuzzy string matching is a technique for finding a string that matches a pattern approximately (rather than exactly). In other words, fuzzy string matching is a search that finds a match even if the user misspells a word or enters only part of a word to search. Therefore, it is also known as string approximate matching. String fuzzy search can be used in various applications, such as</description>

      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, a project was about to go live, and we needed to pressure test the core interface; since our interface is gRPC protocol, we found that there are not as many pressure testing tools as HTTP.
Finally I found the tool ghz, which is also very full-featured.
Afterwards I wondered why there are so few tools for gRPC piezos, what are the difficulties? In order to verify this problem, I am going to write a tool myself.</description>

      <description>Introduction to MQTT MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an instant messaging protocol developed by IBM. It is designed with lightness, openness, simplicity, and specification in mind, and is therefore easy to implement. These features make it a good choice for many scenarios, including constrained environments such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things environments (IoT) that require very small code packages or very expensive network bandwidth.
The MQTT protocol is a protocol designed for the communication of a large number of remote sensors and control devices with limited computing power and operating on low-bandwidth, unreliable networks, and has several key features, as follows.</description>

      <description>What is a hash ? Hash is the transformation of an input of arbitrary length (also called pre-image) into an output of fixed length by a hashing algorithm, and that output is the hash value. This transformation is a compressed mapping, i.e., the space for the hash value is usually much smaller than the space for the input, and different inputs may be hashed into the same output, and it is not possible to uniquely determine the input value from the hash value.</description>

      <description>As we all know, storing plaintext passwords is a very bad thing. If a database stores a plaintext password, if the data is leaked, then the user account is in danger. Because of this, back in 1976, industry came up with a set of standards for storing passwords securely using a one-way hashing mechanism (starting with Unix Crypt). Unfortunately, while this approach prevents you from reading the password directly, all the hashing mechanism does is prevent an attacker from brute-force cracking it in an offline environment, where the attacker simply traverses a list of possible passwords containing the correct password, hashes each possible password and then compares it to the obtained password (the one stored using the hashing mechanism).</description>

      <description>APK file introduction Each application that needs to be installed to the android platform is compiled and packaged as a separate file with the suffix .apk (Android application package), which contains the binary code, resources, configuration files, etc. of the application. The apk file is actually a zip archive that can be unzipped by an unzip tool (change the suffix to .zip and then unzip it with the unzip file.)</description>

      <description>The datediff function in Hive SQL returns the number of days between 2 dates. One of the more interesting pitfalls found during use is that
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  SELECTcustomer_id,COUNT(DISTINCTdate(createdate))-1ASfrequency,datediff(MAX(createdate),MIN(createdate))ASrecency,datediff(CURRENT_DATE,MIN(createdate))AST,CASEWHENCOUNT(DISTINCTcreatedate)-1=0THEN0ELSESUM(totaltakeoff)/COUNT(DISTINCTcreatedate)ENDASmonetary_valueFROMorderdb.orderdetail  Where createdate is a datetime type, the execution of SQL finds that there is data with recency&amp;gt;T. The following code is executed and the result also has problems.

      <description>Today I learned that there are two ways to save JPEG files they are Baseline JPEG (standard) and Progressive JPEG (progressive). Both formats have the same size and image data, and their extensions are the same, the only difference is that they are displayed differently.
Differences between Baseline JPEG and Progressive JPEG Baseline JPEG
This type of JPEG file is stored in a top-to-bottom scan, saving each line sequentially in the JPEG file.</description>

      <description>Python handles control characters in text Previously, when using Python for crawling, I encountered an error reading the data. After analysis, I found that the returned HTML contains control characters (it turns out that anti-crawler can also do this, control characters in the crawler easily cause errors, but when presented to the user in the browser does not affect anything).
What is a control character? Control characters (Control Character), or non-printing characters, appear in the text of a specific message, indicating a control function characters, such as control characters: LF (line feed), CR (carriage return), FF (page break), DEL (delete), BS (backspace), BEL (ringing), etc.</description>

(unfortunately both parameter and argument are translated into Chinese parameters)
The type parameter also has a type, which is the metadata that describes the behavior of the parameter type, and is called a constraint.</description>

      <description>In the stand-alone era, the use of a single disk for data storage and read/write resulted in very low I/O performance due to addressing and read/write time consumption, and the storage capacity would also be limited. In addition, a single disk is extremely prone to physical failure, often resulting in data loss. Therefore, people wonder if there is a way to combine multiple independent disks together to form a technical solution to improve data reliability and I/O performance.</description>

A file system uses the abstract logical concept of files and tree directories instead of using the concept of data blocks for physical devices such as hard disks and CD-ROMs, so that users using a file system to save data do not have to care about how much data is actually saved on the hard disk (or CD-ROM) at the address of the data block, but only need to You only need to remember the directory and file name of the file.</description>

      <description>In the PC era, when a user asks for a page, we will first check whether a SessionId exists in the user&amp;rsquo;s cookie, and if it does not exist, we will generate a SessionId by random number and store it in the cookie. If it exists, we will update the expiration time of this cookie (after 30 minutes). That is, as long as the user visits the interval within 30 minutes is considered the same Seesion, more than 30 minutes will generate a new SeesionId and define browsing as a new Session.</description>

      <description>There are two types of loops you can use in Python: for loops and while loops. You can use them for repetitive tasks. As a result, repetitive tasks will happen automatically, making the process more efficient. Unfortunately, you may run into some problems with your loops. Sometimes your program may run into problems that require it to skip a part of the loop or exit the loop altogether. Or you may need it to ignore external factors that affect the program.</description>

      <description>Apache Kafka is the most popular distributed messaging publish-subscribe system available today. While Kafka is very powerful, it is equally complex and requires a highly available and robust platform to run. In a world where microservices are prevalent and most companies are adopting distributed computing, it is still very advantageous to use Kafka as a core messaging system.
If you run your microservices in a Kubernetes cluster, it makes sense to run a Kafka cluster in Kubernetes to take advantage of its built-in resiliency and high availability, and we can easily interact with Kafka Pods within the cluster using the built-in Kubernetes service discovery.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Decorators A decorator is a high-level Python syntax. It can be used to process a function, method, or class. In Python, we have several ways to process functions and classes. Compared to other ways, decorator syntax is simple and the code is highly readable. As a result, decorators have a wide range of applications in Python projects. Decorators are often used in scenarios with tangential requirements, some classic</description>

      <description>Background In the existing network environment, some businesses using Redis clusters often need to perform node expansion operations as their business volume rises. I have previously learned that after some operations and maintenance students expanded Redis clusters with a large number of nodes, the business side reported a decrease in cluster performance, as evidenced by a significant increase in access latency. Some businesses are sensitive to Redis cluster access latency,</description>

      <description>Enumerations are data types that are supported by TypeScript. Enumerations allow you to define a set of named constants. Use them to more easily document intent or create a different set of cases. Mostly used in object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C#, enumerations are now also available in TypeScript. They are one of the few features of TypeScript that is not a type-level extension of JavaScript. Next I</description>

      <description>A pointer is an address value that points to the start of an area of memory. So you need to have a good knowledge of computer composition principles. Generally speaking, it is important to maintain a deep memory of what is told in this course and then accumulate it day by day to really reach an understanding.
The concept of a pointer in a high-level language is not fundamentally different from a pointer on a low-level interface.</description>

As I gained experience, I gradually learned a lot of similar points that I was excited about, and the Unsafe technique was definitely one of them.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes Ingress is just a common resource object in Kubernetes that requires a corresponding Ingress Controller to resolve Ingress rules and expose the service to the outside, such as ingress-nginx, which is essentially just an Nginx Pod that then redirects requests to This Pod itself is also exposed through the Kubernetes service, most commonly through LoadBalancer.
Again, this article wants to give you a simple and clear overview of what&amp;rsquo;s behind Kubernetes Ingress to make it easier for you to understand the Ingress in use.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-10/add-dns-record-for-pod/</guid>
      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
 etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>

Kirito is also working on the topic &amp;ldquo;RocketMQ Storage System Design for Hot and Cold Read/Write Scenarios&amp;rdquo;, but we are participating in the internal track, so we can&amp;rsquo;t rank with our external partners.

ByteBuffer has two main implementation classes
 HeapByteBuffer In-heap memory DirectByteBuffer Off-heap memory  In my personal experience, I tend to use DirectByteBuffer in most cases, both for read and write operations, mainly because HeapByteBuffer may have some unexpected internal operations when interacting with FileChannel, which is the caveat mentioned in the title of this article, so let&amp;rsquo;s sell it here.</description>

      <description>Visitor Pattern The accessor pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows arbitrary detached visitors to be able to access managed elements under the control of the manager. The visitor cannot change the definition of the object (but this is not mandatory, you can agree to allow changes). For the manager, it does not care how many visitors there actually are, it only cares about a defined order of access to the elements (for example, for a binary tree, you can provide multiple access orders such as mid-order, pre-order, etc.</description>

      <description>Since FastDFS distributed file storage does not retain the original file name when uploading files, when the file is uploaded it returns a file ID in the following format, which contains the group the file is in, the secondary directory, and a base64-encoded file name generated from the client&amp;rsquo;s IP, timestamp, and file size. The file ID is stored in the client database and can only be accessed by the</description>

When a third-party library method needs to be defined separately, and the library does not export the method&amp;rsquo;s input type, you need to get the method&amp;rsquo;s input type.
For example, there is the following example function, we want to get its parameter type and return value type, so how should we implement it.

      <description>Compared to React 16, the new features of React17 are featureless, so the upgrade from 16 to 17 is relatively smooth. One disruptive change, however, is the change in the event system. In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the document level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered. Exceptions are thrown wherever document.addEventListener is used</description>

This diagram is an application scenario of linux analysis tools from Brendan Gregg, and you can see that it includes almost every part of the system that should be analyzed with the tools.

      <description>There are three ways to register Qt types for multithreading, namely inheriting QThread, using QObject&amp;rsquo;s moveToThread function and Qtconcurrent concurrent threads. In many articles, it is recommended to inherit from the QThread class and override the run method to use time-consuming manipulation code in run. This approach makes us think that QThread is the entity of the thread. Creating a QThread object is thought of as opening a new thread.</description>

      <description>The goal is to implement a realistic HTTP HTTPS proxy server, and there are currently two ways to implement a proxy
Plain Proxy : This proxy plays the role of a middleman, for the client it is the server, for the server it is the client, it is responsible for passing HTTP messages back and forth in the middle
Tunnel Proxy : It is a proxy that is done through the HTTP body, which is a TCP-based application layer proxy that uses the CONNECT method of HTTP to establish a connection.</description>

Component A Vue page is composed of a component, and the component&amp;rsquo;s class in Vue is Component, which inherits from ComponentOptions, FunctionalComponent and ComponentPublicInstanceConstructor.
Of these, ComponentOptions inherits from ComponentOptionsBase, which is the declarative options component we often write that contains properties such as data, methods, etc.</description>

      <description>You can use generics in Go 1.17. The current master branch, by default, already supports generics, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to add the -G=3 parameter.
You can try the latest branch of go by following these steps:
1 2  go get golang.org/dl/gotip gotip download   Just use the gotip command instead of go when compiling your code.
With the release of Go 1.17, there have been a lot of articles on Go generics, but they are basically brief introductory articles.</description>

In order to implement Effectively once, pulsar supports it in two ways.
 Effectively-once publishing: ensuring that messages are sent only once Effectively-once consumer: ensuring that messages are consumed only once  Effectively-once publishing pulsar supports the guarantee that only one copy of a message will be stored in pulsar in the event of extreme conditions such as broker failure, producer failure, network failure, etc.</description>

1  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;#34;file&amp;#34;&amp;gt;   We can specify the type of file to be selected with the accept property, the directory property specifies whether a folder can be selected, and the capture property specifies the front or rear camera.
It&amp;rsquo;s still very powerful.
But the file input box has the fatal disadvantage that the UI is too ugly and not customizable.</description>

There are two scenarios for this. In one case, you need all the code changes in another branch, so you use git merge. In the other case, you only need some of the code changes (a few commits), then you can use Cherry pick.
Basic usage What the git cherry-pick command does is apply the specified commit to other branches.</description>

      <description>Web technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, but there is one area that has been impossible to break through &amp;mdash;- games.
The performance requirements for games are so high that some large games struggle to run even on a PC, let alone in the sandbox model of a browser! However, despite the difficulties, many developers have never given up and want to make browsers run 3D games.
In 2012, Alon Zakai, an engineer at Mozilla, was working on the LLVM compiler and had the idea that many 3D games are written in C/C++, so if we could compile C/C++ into JavaScript code, they would run in the browser.</description>

      <description>When it comes to front-end performance optimization, we usually think of enabling compression to compress the resource file size. Or enabling browser caching can have the effect of optimizing resource loading speed with fewer HTTP requests, but these means mainly improve the loading speed when repeatedly accessing the same resources. By default, the browser will only load resources declared in HTML first. If it is not declared, the browser will not load the resource earlier.</description>

      <description>Redis 6.0 has been released more than a year ago.
The new features in Redis 6.0 have been identified through step-by-step discussions and optimizations.
Many of these features have already been introduced in previous releases such as RC.
However, there are some new changes in the official GA release:
 SSL ACL: better, command support RESP3 Client side caching: redesigned Threaded I/O Diskless replication on replicas Cluster support in Redis-benchmark and improved redis-cli cluster support Disque in beta as a module of Redis: starting to invade the message queue space Redis Cluster Proxy Support for immediate deletion when the RDB is no longer in use, for scenarios where the disk is not dropped PSYNC2: Optimized replication protocol More friendly timeout setting support Faster RDB loading, 20% ~ 30% improvement STRALGO, new string command, currently only one implementation of LCS (longest common subsequence)  @antirez mentioned that it was only the largest version update in Redis history, so it was prudent to recommend more testing and evaluation of the product in the application, and promised to release version 6.</description>

      <description>1. Overview The JavaScript language uses a single-threaded model, which means that all tasks can only be done on one thread, one thing at a time. If the previous task is not done, the later task has to wait. With the increase in computing power of computers, especially with the advent of multi-core CPUs, single-threading poses a great inconvenience and cannot fully utilize the computing power of computers.
The role of the Web Worker is to create a multi-threaded environment for JavaScript, allowing the main thread to create Worker threads and assign some tasks to the latter to run.</description>

Node comes with an npm module, so you can use the npx command directly. In case it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install it manually.

      <description>Starting with React 16.3, React deprecated some APIs (componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, and componentWillUpdate) and introduced some new ones instead, including getDerivedStateFromProps. getDerivedStateFromProps. Depending on the application scenario, getDerivedStateFromProps is used in different ways.
Semi-controlled components Although React officially does not recommend semi-controlled components, and certainly not from the perspective of API design and maintenance. However, in practice, users often don&amp;rsquo;t care about the internal implementation of a business logic, but want to have full control over some internal state when needed, so semi-controlled components are a good choice.</description>

I made a code repository containing all the examples below, which can be run to see the results.
1. Synchronization AJAX The common practice of sending data back to the server is to put the collected user data inside the unload event and send it back to the server with an AJAX request.
However, asynchronous AJAX inside the unload event may not always work, because the page is already in unload and the browser may or may not send it.</description>

      <description>Handling time is always a headache, no matter what time it is. The time format is too diverse, and it is even more difficult to deal with time zones, daylight saving time, leap seconds and other minor details. Therefore, we usually use standard libraries or time libraries provided by third parties to handle time in our programs. The dateparse we are going to introduce today focuses on a very small area of time processing - parsing strings in date time format.</description>

We know that with cloud services like AWS, it&amp;rsquo;s not very easy to connect to the cloud when developing locally, not to mention that the staging/production environment will have security considerations. So when we create a project, how do we build its local development environment to facilitate our local development and debugging? That&amp;rsquo;s right!</description>

Previously, many gateway applications used the Spring-Cloud-Netfilx solution based on the Zuul1.x version, but given that Zuul1.x had stopped iterating, it used a more traditional blocking</description>

      <description>The Go module not only follows the semantic version specification 2.0.0, but also goes a step further by giving deeper meaning to the major in the semantic version.
 X.X: For the case where the major version number (major) is 0, it implies that your current API is still in an unstable state, and the new minor version may not be backward compatible. X.X: the current API is in a stable state, the increase of minor only means the increase of new feature, the API is still backward compatible X.</description>

For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.
Q: Now I have an image in this format, how can I copy it into the system pasteboard?</description>

Of course, we can also customize our listeners to listen to Spring&amp;rsquo;s original events. Or we can customize</description>

We can customize the GatewayFilter to do additional extensions to achieve some functionality that does not exist in the built-in GatewayFilter and apply it to our routing configuration.
How to customize GatewayFilter To customize GatewayFilter, you need to implement the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.GatewayFilterFactory interface, and the definition of GatewayFilterFactory is as follows.</description>

      <description>fetch() is an upgraded version of XMLHttpRequest used to make HTTP requests inside JavaScript scripts.
The browser provides this object natively. This article describes its usage in detail.
1. Basic usage The function of fetch() is basically the same as XMLHttpRequest, but with three main differences.
 fetch() uses Promise and does not use a callback function, so it is much simpler to write and more concise. The modular design of fetch(), with API spread over multiple objects (Response object, Request object, Headers object), is more reasonable; in contrast, the API design of XMLHttpRequest is not very good, with input, output and state all managed in the same interface, making it easy to write very confusing code.</description>

      <description>This article mainly analyzes the usage of Introspector. Introspector is a tool class that deals specifically with JavaBean and is used to get the descriptors in JavaBean. The commonly used descriptor-related classes of JavaBean are BeanInfo, PropertyDescriptor, MethodDescriptor, BeanDescriptor, EventSetDescriptor and ParameterDescriptor. The following will slowly analyze how these classes are used, as well as some of the features of Introspector.
What is JavaBean JavaBean is a special (actually, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to say ordinary, it&amp;rsquo;s not very special) class, mainly used to pass data information, the methods in this class are mainly used to access private fields, and the method names conform to some naming rules (fields are private, each field has Setter and Getter methods, methods and fields named to meet the first letter lower case hump naming ).</description>

      <description>In large applications, it is a common design pattern to configure master-slave databases and use read-write separation. In Spring applications, to implement read-write separation, it is best to not make changes to existing code, but to support it transparently at the bottom.
Spring has a built-in AbstractRoutingDataSource that can configure multiple data sources into a Map and then, depending on the key, return different data sources. Because AbstractRoutingDataSource is also a DataSource interface, the application can set the key first, and the code that accesses the database can get the corresponding real data source from AbstractRoutingDataSource to access the specified database.</description>

PostgreSQL json development history. postgreSQL has supported json data type since 9.2, but due to the poor performance of parsing json data, it is not favored by everyone, but choose to use nosql database instead. So from pg9.4 onwards, the jsonb data type was supported. Compared to the json type, jsonb does not need to be parsed every time it is used, so the performance is much improved, and it also supports index queries and so on.</description>

It can synchronize files between the local computer and a remote computer, or between two local directories (but does not support synchronization between two remote computers). It can also be used as a file copying tool, replacing the cp and mv commands.
The r in its name refers to remote, rsync actually means &amp;ldquo;remote synchronization&amp;rdquo;. Unlike other file transfer tools (such as FTP or scp), rsync&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it checks the existing files of both the sender and the receiver and only transfers the parts that have changed (the default rule is that the file size or modification time has changed).</description>

      <description>Redis is an efficient object caching application. If you have a Wordpress site based on Litespeed (OpenLitespeed) server and you have LSCache installed, you can further speed up your site with an object cache.
However, you can only choose to install one of the object cache programs, Redis and Memcached. For Litespeed/Wordpress systems, there is not much difference in performance between the two as object cache programs. Today we will cover how to install a Redis server.</description>

      <description>1 Does an empty structure take up space? In Go, we can use unsafe.Sizeof to calculate the number of bytes an instance of a data type needs to occupy.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;unsafe&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(struct{}{})) }   Running the above example will output:
1 2  $ go run main.go 0   That is, an instance of the empty struct struct{} does not occupy any memory space.</description>

      <description>The dart language used by Flutter has a garbage collection mechanism, and with garbage collection, memory leaks are inevitable. There is a memory leak detection tool LeakCanary on the Android platform that can easily detect if the current page is leaking in a debug environment. This article will take you through the implementation of a flutter-ready LeakCanary and tell you how I used it to detect two leaks on the 1.</description>

      <description>go module is the official version management tool introduced after Go 1.11, and since Go 1.13, go module has been the default dependency management tool for the Go language. Since Go 1.14, the go modules feature has been officially recommended for use in production environments.
Here is a detailed description of how to use the go module to import local packages.
Prerequisites Suppose we now have two packages, moduledemo and mypackage, where the moduledemo package will import the mypackage package and use its New method.</description>

      <description>Go compiles programs that are perfect for deployment, and if no other libraries are referenced through CGO, we generally compile executable binaries that are single files, perfect for copying and deployment. In practice, in addition to binaries, you may also need some configuration files, or static files, such as html templates, static images, CSS, javascript, etc. How these files can also be typed into the binary would be fantastic, and we could just copy and follow the single executable.</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a problem, that is, how to implement two-way binding prop in Vue.js is better.
Previously I was passing the prop to the child component, and then the child component directly changed the prop directly, this can reflect the result to the parent component, but it is not a good solution.
For example, I often encounter this Warning.
 Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten…</description>

      <description>Goroutine 1 2 3  for { go func() {}() }   The threshold for using Goroutine is really low, and there are a lot of abuses.
Goroutine Leak The causes of Goroutine leaks are usually:
 Read/write operations such as channel/mutex are being performed inside Goroutine, but due to logic problems, they are blocked all the time in some cases. The business logic within the Goroutine enters a dead loop and resources are never released.</description>

      <description>When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
JDBC batch execute When using JDBC, you can use Statement#addBatch(String sql) or PreparedStatement#addBatch method to add SQL statements to the batch list, and then execute them in batch with the executeBatch method. When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
reWriteBatchedInserts=true The PostgreSQL JDBC driver supports the reWriteBatchedInserts=true join parameter to modify multiple insert/update statements into a single statement, for example: insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;); insert into test(name) values (&#39;m&#39;); is modified to insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;), (&#39;m&#39;); .</description>

      <description>Exception handling is very important in front-end, including client-side and server-side exceptions. Previously, exception handling was to add err handling for each asynchronous function, which not only increased the workload, but also easily missed some exceptions. Fortunately, Angular6 provides ErrorHandler to handle exceptions (Ionic4 for IonicErrorHandler), the default ErrorHandler handling exceptions is to output it on the console, which obviously can not meet the demand, so you need to implement</description>

      <description>1, Introduction Browsers allow JavaScript scripts to read and write to the clipboard to automatically copy or paste content.
In general, scripts should not alter the user&amp;rsquo;s clipboard in a way that does not meet the user&amp;rsquo;s expectations. However, there are times when this is convenient, such as the &amp;ldquo;one-click copy&amp;rdquo; feature, where the user clicks a button and the specified content automatically goes to the clipboard.
Currently, there are three ways to implement clipboard operations.</description>

      <description>There are two types of channels in Go language, a channel without cache and a buffer with cache, both of which we are familiar with.
Why am I suddenly talking about this infinite cache channel? The main reason is that I was recently reviewing a colleague&amp;rsquo;s code and I had a problem with a certain design idea that would have been solved by using an infinite cache channel.
 A dispatcher contains a channel, which holds the URLs to be processed A bunch of workers read tasks from the channel, download and parse the page, extract the links, and put the links into the dispatcher.</description>
