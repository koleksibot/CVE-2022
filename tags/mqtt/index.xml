      <description>Introduction to MQTT MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an instant messaging protocol developed by IBM. It is designed with lightness, openness, simplicity, and specification in mind, and is therefore easy to implement. These features make it a good choice for many scenarios, including constrained environments such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things environments (IoT) that require very small code packages or very expensive network bandwidth.
The MQTT protocol is a protocol designed for the communication of a large number of remote sensors and control devices with limited computing power and operating on low-bandwidth, unreliable networks, and has several key features, as follows.</description>
