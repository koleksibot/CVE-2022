      <description>There is no such thing as x32. x86 and x64 refer to the instruction set architecture of the CPU.
Instruction set The instruction set can be understood as the hardware&amp;rsquo;s interface to the outside world. We run programs through the operating system scheduling, and the operating system then allows the hardware to compute.
If you let the hardware compute, such as some addition and multiplication, loops and so on, you need the interface provided by the hardware, that is, the instruction set.</description>

      <description>A short, straightforward introduction to modern processor microarchitecture design.
 Today&amp;rsquo;s robots are very primitive, capable of understanding only a few simple instructions such as &amp;lsquo;go left&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;go right&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;build car&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>Mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) are the two most common types of hard drives used as external storage for computers, and it takes a long time for the CPU to access the data they store, as shown in the table below, where it takes 1,500 times longer to access a random 4KB of data in an SSD than it does to access the main memory, and 100,000 times longer to seek a mechanical disk than it does to access the main memory.</description>

      <title>CPU and GPU - The Evolution and Development of Heterogeneous Computing</title>

      <description>The pattern of development of most things in the world is similar. In the beginning, relatively general solutions tend to appear to solve most problems, followed by solutions specifically designed for a certain scenario that do not solve general problems but perform extremely well in some specific areas. In the field of computing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are general-purpose and specific solutions, respectively, with the former providing the most basic computing power to solve almost any problem, and the latter excelling in areas such as graphics computing and machine learning.</description>
