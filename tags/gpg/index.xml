      <title>Modify the GPG UID name</title>

      <description>The previous GPG UID name was Scvoet, which is my username. Some time ago, I changed the nickname of each platform to my English name Percy, and today I changed the UID name of GPG to my English name as well.
 The information returned by the command has been trimmed down to remove most of the unnecessary confirmation and key list display.
 Open the command line tool and enter the email address associated with the UID.</description>

      <description>Because of the email-based identity verification feature of Git, you can easily fake being someone else to make a Commit. How do you ensure that the Commit is really a developer commit? This is where a special key, the GPG key, is needed for authentication.
About GPG GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a cryptographic software for encrypting and signing communication content and managing keys for asymmetric cryptography.
Asymmetric cryptography is a technique that you should have come across, and it is used in many fields.</description>
