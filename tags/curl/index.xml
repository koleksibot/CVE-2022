      <title>cURL will natively support JSON</title>

      <description>cURL author Daniel Stenberg emailed revealed about plans to add native support for JSON to cURL.
Daniel explains the reasons for adding native JSON support to cURL:
 sending JSON is a common practice in areas such as REST APIs &amp;ldquo;Ease of use with JSON&amp;rdquo; was a common consideration when many people were asked about choosing a cURL alternative on sites like Stack Overflow, a significant number of people were unable to send the correct JSON and quote JSON correctly using cURL because JSON uses double quotes and the Shell does not expand variables inside single quotes  Daniel also said that since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t send JSON very often, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate to rely entirely on him to design this feature.</description>

      <description>When accessing a gRPC streaming interface (converted to HTTP) with cURL before, a very strange phenomenon occurred.
 when directly cuRL, always the full content is displayed and the connection does not break, because it is a streaming interface, which is exactly the expected behavior. And when cURL | ... or cURL &amp;gt; file, the full content is never available, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work no matter how long you wait.  Why is this?</description>
