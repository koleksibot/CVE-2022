      <description>Many people have an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; computer at home, which may have been forgotten in a corner because of slow startup, outdated configuration, or incompatible software that you often use. Its next fate is either to remain in the corner or to be recycled.
Google&amp;rsquo;s new Chrome OS Flex is a chance to rejuvenate these old devices.
Chrome OS Flex is a new system from Google that differs from regular Chrome OS in that you can install it on devices that were originally based on Windows or macOS (not ARM chips), turning them into Chromebooks.</description>

      <title>After 8 years, Chrome gets a new logo</title>

      <description>Google has recently released the latest version of Chrome Canary, in which Chrome has a &amp;ldquo;brand new&amp;rdquo; logo, which is the fourth version of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s logo since its birth in 2008.
Although this is a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; logo for Chrome in 8 years, you can see that the changes are not too drastic. Even at first glance, you can hardly tell what has changed.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some of the design details and see what&amp;rsquo;s different between the new version and the old one.</description>

      <title>Enable Tab Search on your own blog</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/tab-to-search/</link>

      <description>Chrome has a feature where you can enter a domain name in the address bar and press the Tab key to enter a search. This makes it easy to search for a site&amp;rsquo;s content.

This feature is called Tab to Search. Of course, not every site supports it, as the search interface varies from site to site. However, this feature is not an adaptation of Chrome for well-known sites, but is implemented through an open standard OpenSearch description format .</description>

      <title>Chrome enhances enterprise scalability and improves IT staff management efficiency</title>

      <description>For years, Google has been working to minimise the security risks posed by Chrome extensions by making it more difficult for users to manually install extensions from unknown sources, and by increasing security audits of the Chrome Web Store. Now, Google has introduced a new option for Chrome&amp;rsquo;s enterprise administrators that allows &amp;lsquo;managed&amp;rsquo; Chrome users to request additional extensions as needed, and after review, the administrator can decide whether to allow the user to install them.</description>

      <title>Chrome tests tab caching feature to instantly restart closed pages</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-08/chrome-test-closed-tab-cache/</link>

      <description>Some users may only open a small number of pages that they currently need to use, while others may open all the tabs that they want to use now and may want to use later. In the latter case, the tabs are stacked together and inevitably closed by mistake, and the user may need to reopen it.
All browsers on the market today have an &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; option to restore closed tabs, which is only available in regular browsing windows, not in incognito or private browsing windows.</description>

      <description>Mozilla recently revealed that they will introduce a new feature in Firefox browser that will prevent users from downloading unsafe files in a mixed content environment.
Mixed content refers to a website that uses both a secure connection and an insecure connection.
This is an example of what Mozilla means by mixed content: a user visits a secure site that uses HTTPS, clicks on a link to start downloading the desired content, but the link points to a reso.</description>

      <title>Google plans to bring a full version of Chrome to Fuchsia OS</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-08/chrome-browser-fuchsia-os/</link>

      <description>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s desktop, mobile or a smart home device with a screen, every operating system needs a web browser, and while Fuchsia OS already uses some of Chromium&amp;rsquo;s code, Google is preparing to bring Chrome and all its features to Fuchsia OS.
As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>
