      <description>Recently, Twitter user Florian said: Microsoft has added some ads to the File Explorer in its Windows 11 Insider preview version.
As the screenshot shows, Microsoft uses such ads to promote other Microsoft products and &amp;ldquo;write confidently in documents, email and on the web with advanced writing suggestions from Microsoft Editor.
The old File Explorer was already a point of criticism for Windows, and Microsoft has worked hard to improve the ease of use and appearance of its default File Explorer, such as the recently added &amp;ldquo;tabs&amp;rdquo; feature that opens multiple folder tabs like a browser.</description>

      <description>I remember a dozen years ago when I was still using the early Windows system, every time the system would become very laggy, then you need to open the system provides the following disk defragmentation program, when the defragmentation is complete will feel the system becomes slightly smoother some.
In the file system, defragmentation is the process of reducing fragmentation in the file system, which rearranges the contents of the same files on the disk in order and uses compression algorithms to remove gaps between files, somewhat similar to the tag compression algorithm in garbage collection.</description>

      <description>A computer&amp;rsquo;s file system is a method of storing and organizing computer data, which makes it easy to access and find. A file system uses the abstract logical concept of files and tree directories instead of using the concept of data blocks for physical devices such as hard disks and CD-ROMs, so that users using a file system to save data do not have to care about how much data is actually saved on the hard disk (or CD-ROM) at the address of the data block, but only need to You only need to remember the directory and file name of the file.</description>
