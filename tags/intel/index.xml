      <description>At Architecture Day 2021, Intel announced details about its next-generation client architecture, codenamed &amp;ldquo;Alder Lake&amp;rdquo;.
Intel said Alder Lake will be its first processor architecture to integrate its high efficiency and performance cores, and it includes a performance core and a high efficiency core that deliver 40 percent and 19 percent more performance, respectively, compared to the previous generation. In addition, Alder Lake will support DDR5-4800, LP5-5200, DDR4-3200 and LP4x-4266 memory, as well as 16 PCIe Gen 5 lanes.</description>

      <description>In a blog post, James Reinders, Intel&amp;rsquo;s long-time compiler expert, revealed that they will be using the LLVM open source infrastructure for the next generation of Intel C/C++ compilers; and shared some information about it.
&amp;ldquo;LLVM helps us achieve our goal of providing the best C/C++ compiler for the Intel architecture. The latest Intel C/C++ compilers use LLVM to provide faster compile times, better optimizations, enhanced standards support, and support for GPU and FPGA offloading &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; The benefits of using LLVM are many and I will provide recommendations for upgrading from a classic compiler to an LLVM-based compiler.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Intel engineers committed a large amount of code on the DRM-Next branch of the Linux kernel, mainly on the kernel graphics driver, with the following highlights.
 Extensive code refactoring to increase the use of TTM dispensers and prepare for the DRM scheduler. Cleaned up uAPI and dropped faster GPU relocation paths on older platforms, instead mitigating performance issues by updating to the latest UMD version. Initially implemented code for ADL-P/XeHP and DG2 platforms, fixed ADL-S and removed CNL code.</description>
