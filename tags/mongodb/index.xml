      <description>The database used by Open Hackathon is MongoDB, and in containerization, the security of data is a top priority.
Storage issues Stateful applications need to use PersistentVolume when deployed on Kubernetes, but if the underlying PV storage is unreliable, even with PV, data security is still not guaranteed.
In a general usage scenario, the application needs to define a PersistentVolumeClaim to describe the required storage resources and use the PersistentVolumeClaim in the Pod, and the cluster will create or find a PersistentVolumeClaim based on the description in the PersistentVolumeClaim.</description>
