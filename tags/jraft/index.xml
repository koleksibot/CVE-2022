      <description>Distributed Systems and the Consistency Problem The consistency problem is a core problem that needs to be solved in distributed systems. Distributed systems are generally composed of multiple nodes of equal status, and the interaction between the nodes is like several people getting together to discuss a problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a more specific scenario, such as three people discussing where to eat at noon, the first person said that a hot pot restaurant has just opened nearby, and I heard that the taste is very good; but the second person said, no, it takes too long to eat hot pot, or just drink some porridge; and the third person said, I just went to that porridge restaurant yesterday, it&amp;rsquo;s too bad, it&amp;rsquo;s better to go to McDonalds.</description>
