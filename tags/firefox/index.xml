      <description>Mozilla this week enabled automatic Tab Unloading for Firefox Nightly on Windows, which significantly improves low memory usage and reduces the likelihood of browser crashes.
Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s development of Firefox Tab Unloading began more than 10 years ago, but Mozilla has never enabled the feature in any of the browser&amp;rsquo;s previous releases. Tab Unloading was stalled two years ago due to detection of low memory errors.
Tab unloading is now a feature in Firefox Nightly for Windows, which is currently in version 93 and is expected to be released in Firefox 93 for Windows later this year.</description>

As long as users have some observation of others around them, they will find that more and more users have switched to Chromium-based browsers instead of Firefox.
Recently, Firefox published its public data report since 2018, and the official report is a further confirmation of users&#39; observations.</description>
