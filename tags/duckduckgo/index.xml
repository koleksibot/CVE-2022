      <description>DuckDuckGo is the world&amp;rsquo;s leading Internet search engine, launched in 2008. DuckDuckGo emphasizes protecting the privacy of searchers by not collecting user data or tracking users during searches and by not displaying personalized advertisements like Google searches. DuckDuckGo also offers a browser extension that provides users with privacy protection services such as anti-tracking and encryption protection.
