      <description>Regardless of the field, building is often much more difficult than destroying. Building a building may take years, while destroying it may be a matter of seconds. At the root of this, because construction is an entropy-reducing process, there must be an input of energy from outside the system. One type of problem in creation that seems even more special is the problem of origins. How did the first life</description>

      <description>Some time ago, when doing some tests, I came across Linux tc, because I needed to add a delay to the packets, I used netem in tc. It is very easy to add a simple delay, just one command like this: $ tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 1s, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to fully understand the meaning of the parameters in the command . But when you want to do some more specific restrictions, (such as adding delay only to a specific ip port, or adding delay only to inbound traffic), things get a little tricky, and a simple Google search doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to satisfy the requirements anymore.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/nginx-slab/</guid>
      <description>I first learned about the slab algorithm when I was learning the Linux kernel. The kernel uses the Buddy System algorithm to manage memory pages. But for small objects, it would be wasteful to use a page allocator, so slab was born. The kernel&amp;rsquo;s kmalloc() is managed using slab. nginx&amp;rsquo;s shared memory management uses the same idea, but it is not as complex as slab in the Linux kernel. slab</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s network applications have shifted from CPU-intensive to I/O-intensive, and most of the network servers are based on the C-S model, i.e., the Client-Server model, which requires a lot of network communication between the client and the server, which also determines the performance bottleneck of modern network applications: I/O. The standard I/O interface of the traditional Linux operating system is based on data copy operations, i.e. I/O operations result in</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/linux-process-scheduling/</guid>
      <description>When participating in interviews, Linux processes should be considered a must for me, because many languages don&amp;rsquo;t bother to implement a set of process management and scheduling, but instead borrow directly from the operating system, especially the Python community which sees no need to duplicate the wheel in this area and uses a simple wrapper around system calls. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen to the concurrent code you write if you don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Linux processes.</description>

      <description>It is the essence of an operating system to provide the ability to run programs. And in Linux, light and correspondingly fast process management is one of its good features. In this article, the focus is on the description, and life cycle of Linux processes.
Descriptors and task structures A process is a program in execution and usually includes some resources, such as files, pending signals, internal kernel data, processor state, memory space, and one or more threads of execution.</description>

      <description>The program itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to care where its data and code live, and memory appears to be contiguous and exclusive to the program. This is certainly not the case, and it is the operating system that is responsible for this - memory virtualization. This article describes how the operating system implements a virtual memory system.

      <description>What is systemtap We generally debug our programs, and the logs printed by the business process are basically sufficient for our needs. If not, using strace, lsof, or perf is enough to see the bottleneck of performance. But for system programming, you can&amp;rsquo;t print logs like crazy, and many call stacks are in kernel space, so ordinary debugging means are stretched to the limit.
At this point systemtap comes in handy, it adds probe probes to kernel functions, aggregates statistics on kernel space function calls, and even intervenes in them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/linux-kernel-new-cgroups-vulnerability/</guid>
      <description>A new cgroups vulnerability, codenamed CVE-2022-0492, which could be abused to evade containers in order to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.
The vulnerability comes from a Linux kernel feature known as cgroups control group, cgroups allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups so that CPU, memory, and other resource usage, disk I/O, and networking can be limited and monitored.
However, because cgroups lacks internal validation of the release_agent file and fails to properly check whether the process setting the release_agent file has administrative privileges, an attacker can use this cgroups v1 release_agent feature to elevate privileges and accidentally bypass namespace isolation.</description>

      <description>Anyone who has followed Bare Metal related projects will have seen how the boot process, how to quickly provision a physical server, etc. is implemented, usually with a LiveOS running to achieve certain actions. The Tinkerbell project uses Linuxkit as the LiveOS, and the Plunder project uses BOOTy as the LiveOS. a few days ago @thebsdbox took out a part of BOOTy and showed the main implementation as ginit, so we can better understand the details of the installation.</description>

      <description>This article describes the basics of the Linux pkill command.
pkill is a command-line program that can be sent to a running process based on a specified standard signal. A process can be specified by its full or partial name, the user running the process, or other attributes.
The pkill command is part of the procps (or procps-ng) package, which is pre-installed in almost all Linux distributions. pkill is a wrapper for the pgrep program, which prints a list of matching processes only.</description>

      <description>According to news on the Linux kernel mailing list, the community recently discussed whether to adopt the modern C language standard for the kernel.
While the Linux kernel is evolving rapidly, it also relies on some very old tools, one of which is that the kernel code is still using the 1989 version of the C language standard - a standard that was written more than 30 years ago before the kernel project was started.</description>

      <description>Before we get into the Zombie process, let me recall what a process is in Linux.
In short, a process is a program instance. It can be foreground (interactive process) or background (non-interactive or automatic process). It can be a parent process (the creator of other processes at runtime) or a child process (a process created by other processes).
In Linux, every process has a parent process, except for the first init (or systemd) process with a PID of 0.</description>

      <description>The seq command is an abbreviation for sequence and is used to print a sequence of numbers in increasing or decreasing order. In other words, it prints a range of specified values. The numbers can be integers or real numbers with decimal points, or negative numbers. You can also specify the upper or lower limit of the sequence, etc.
In this tutorial, we will explain how to use the seq command and seq common command options, such as printing a sequence of numbers up to the upper limit, printing a specified value between the lower and upper digits, printing a sequence with custom increments, printing a sequence in decreasing or inverted order, printing a sequence with the same number of digits, printing a sequence in a specified format, printing a sequence using a specified separator, and finally we give you a practical application example for your reference.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-02/why-you-should-add-swap-space/</guid>
      <description>We know that using Linux swap space instead of RAM (memory) can seriously degrade performance. So, one might ask, since I have enough available memory, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to remove the swap space? The short answer is no. Enabling swap space brings performance benefits, even if you have more than enough RAM.
Even with enough server memory installed, you will often find that you will use swap space after a long period of normal operation.</description>

      <description>This article describes the basic use of threads on Linux. 1. Preface Difference between threads and processes (1) Process: It is the smallest unit of OS scheduling. ps, top, etc. commands can be used to view the details of processes under Linux. (2) Thread: It is the smallest unit of process scheduling, each process has a main thread. The main thing to do in the process is the thread. (3)</description>

      <description>research from Google&amp;rsquo;s security research team, Project Zero, shows that Linux developers are more effective at fixing security vulnerabilities more quickly than anyone else (including Google).
From 2019 to 2021, Project Zero reported a total of 376 issues to vendors within the standard 90-day period.]351 (93.4%) of these bugs have been fixed, 14 (3.7%) have been flagged by the vendor as WontFix, and 11 (2.9%) remain unfixed. At the time of the bulletin, 8 had sometimes passed their fix deadlines; the remaining 3 were still within their fix deadlines.</description>

      <description>1. Splitting files You can use the split command to split files, which supports both text and binary file splitting, and the cat command to merge files.
1.1 Text file splitting When splitting a text file, you can split it by file size or by number of lines of text.
Splitting by file size
When splitting a file by file size, you need to specify the split file size with the -C parameter.</description>

      <description>Today, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about an interesting question: Unplug the cable for a few seconds, then plug it back in, does the original TCP connection still exist?
Some people may say that if the cable is unplugged, it means the physical layer is disconnected, so the upper transport layer should also be disconnected, so the original TCP connection will not exist. Just like when we make a wired phone call, if one party&amp;rsquo;s phone line is unplugged, the call is completely disconnected.</description>

      <description>In C/C++ programs, global variables are shared by all threads by default, and developers need to deal with multi-threaded competition. There are cases where we need to make sure that one thread has an exclusive share of the data and that other threads cannot access it. A typical case is the errno global variable, which always stores the error code of the last call of the current thread, without thread</description>

      <description>What would the world be like without Linux?
More than twenty years ago, Linus Torvalds, the father of Linux, said, &amp;ldquo;If 386BSD had been available before I created Linux, then Linux might not have been born.&amp;rdquo;
Later, when people look back and reflect, there is no shortage of people who think: &amp;ldquo;If Linux had not flourished, FreeBSD would have filled the void today.&amp;rdquo;
BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, also known as Berkeley Unix), the most inextricable offshoot of Unix, had its cradle at the University of California, Berkeley, the most radical leftist stronghold in the United States at the time.</description>

      <description>This article provides an easy and quick introduction to the principles and implementation of the CFS scheduler, a fully fair class scheduling class in the Linux kernel.
Principle The core principle of the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) is simple: each process is given as &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; a runtime as possible. So the process that has run the least in the past is chosen to run each time. Of course, as a scheduler, it has to meet much more than that, and a number of features such as Linux&amp;rsquo;s preemptive processes and support for priorities in the Completely Fair class fair_sched_class make the design of CFS much more complex than simply picking the least amount of runtime.</description>

      <description>Previously, Yu Zhao from Google submitted a Patch to the Linux kernel that modified the page swap algorithm in the kernel memory management module, proposing a multi-level LRU. This article takes you through the advantages of the page swap algorithm and multi-level LRU.
What are pages and page replacement We know that memory paging mechanisms are used on almost all modern operating systems and processors. In some embedded operating systems and in special cases where processor resources are tight and there is no need to consider inter-process safety, or even the concept of threads, memory paging is not necessary.</description>

      <description>fs::symlink_metadata Recently I wrote a program to recursively search for folder statistics and got stuck when measuring the size of a folder I used find -type l to search for soft links and found two links referenced recursively: a points to b&amp;rsquo;s folder while b points to a&amp;rsquo;s folder Looking at the source code, I realized that the underlying std::fs::metadata call stat() system call would follow the link I switched</description>

      <description>CPU and Main memory are scarce resources in an operating system. All processes running in the current operating system share the CPU and memory resources in the system, and the operating system uses CPU scheduler to allocate CPU time and introduces virtual memory system to manage physical memory.
Before we can answer the need for virtual memory, we need to understand what virtual memory is in an operating system and what role it plays in the operating system.</description>

      <description>A system call is a way for a computer program to request services from the operating system kernel during execution. This may include hardware-related services, the creation and execution of new processes, and process scheduling. Anyone with a little knowledge of operating systems knows that - system calls provide the user program with an interface to the operating system.
The famous glibc for C language encapsulates the system calls provided by the operating system and provides a well-defined interface that allows engineers to develop upper-level applications directly using the functions encapsulated in the container.</description>

      <title>Why is the default page size for Linux 4KB?</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-linux-default-page/</guid>
      <description>We all know that Linux manages memory in pages. Whether it is loading data from disk into memory or writing data from memory back to disk, the operating system operates in pages. Even if we write only one byte of data to disk, we need to swipe the entire data from the entire page to disk.
Linux supports both normal-sized memory pages and large memory pages (Huge Page). The default size of memory pages on most processors is 4KB, and although some processors use 8KB, 16KB, or 64KB as the default page size, 4KB pages are still the mainstream of the default memory page configuration of the operating system; in addition to the normal memory page size, different processors also contain large pages of different sizes.</description>

      <description>Memory is an important resource for computers, and while most services today do not require as much memory, databases and Hadoop services are big consumers of memory, consuming GBs and TBs of memory to speed up computations in production environments.
The Linux operating system has introduced a number of strategies to manage this memory better and faster and reduce overhead, and today we are going to introduce HugePages, or large pages.</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows a little bit about Linux knows that Linux divides the physical Random Access Memory (RAM) into 4KB-sized memory blocks by page, and the Swapping mechanism we are going to introduce today is closely related to memory, which is the process of the operating system copying the contents of physical memory pages to the swap space on the hard disk to release the memory. The physical memory and the swap partition on the hard disk make up the virtual memory available on the operating system, and these swap spaces are pre-configured by the system administrator.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/whys-the-design-linux-macos-fragmentation/</guid>
      <description>I believe that many software engineers today use Linux or macOS systems, and unlike Windows, we hardly see the concept of disk defragmentation. From personal experience, the author has not defragmented a disk in macOS for the past seven or eight years, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any related operations in today&amp;rsquo;s disk tools, only the diskutil command to set whether a disk is defragmented on or off.
Windows operating systems may need to defragment their disks every once in a while, and there are two reasons behind this problem: one is that Windows uses a very simple file system called FAT, which is designed in such a way that the same files may be scattered in different locations on the disk, and the other is that solid state drives were not popular in the ancient times and mechanical hard drives have poor random read and write performance.</description>

      <description>Swap in Linux is similar to virtual memory in Windows, which means that when there is a shortage of memory, a portion of the hard disk space can be used as virtual memory, thus solving the problem of insufficient memory capacity.
When installing a Linux system you need to set up a separate swap partition while Windows installation does not have this requirement, mainly because of the different ways of implementation.</description>

      <description>Alyssa Rosenzweig, one of the Asahi Linux developers working on porting Linux to the Apple M1, recently shared a milestone on her social media platforms: namely, that she successfully booted the Debian distribution on an Apple M1 device and into the GNOME Shell desktop environment.
It is worth noting, however, that OpenGL graphics acceleration is not yet supported. The experience currently relies solely on LLVMpipe, a software implementation of Mesa Gallium3D for accelerating OpenGL on the CPU, to achieve the OpenGL acceleration required by the GNOME desktop.</description>

      <description>On August 12, 2021 EST, Google, Microsoft, Isovalent, Facebook, and Netflix jointly announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the eBPF Foundation, under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. The Foundation is dedicated to better promoting the open source project eBPF and supporting the commercial growth of Linux and other open source technologies.
In recent years, the number of eBPF projects has exploded and more and more projects are interested in using eBPF, so it is increasingly important to optimize collaboration between projects, ensure that the core of eBPF is well maintained and configure a clear roadmap for the future of eBPF.</description>

      <description>On Friday, Intel engineers committed a large amount of code on the DRM-Next branch of the Linux kernel, mainly on the kernel graphics driver, with the following highlights.
 Extensive code refactoring to increase the use of TTM dispensers and prepare for the DRM scheduler. Cleaned up uAPI and dropped faster GPU relocation paths on older platforms, instead mitigating performance issues by updating to the latest UMD version. Initially implemented code for ADL-P/XeHP and DG2 platforms, fixed ADL-S and removed CNL code.</description>

      <title>Rsync Usage Tutorial</title>

      <description>1. Introduction rsync is a commonly used Linux application for file synchronization.
It can synchronize files between the local computer and a remote computer, or between two local directories (but does not support synchronization between two remote computers). It can also be used as a file copying tool, replacing the cp and mv commands.
The r in its name refers to remote, rsync actually means &amp;ldquo;remote synchronization&amp;rdquo;. Unlike other file transfer tools (such as FTP or scp), rsync&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it checks the existing files of both the sender and the receiver and only transfers the parts that have changed (the default rule is that the file size or modification time has changed).</description>
