      <description>This paper is about the paper in the 2020 OSDI Journal &amp;ndash; Twine: A Unified Cluster Management System for Shared Infrastructure, which implements Twine, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s cluster management system for production environments for the past decade. Prior to the advent of this system, Facebook&amp;rsquo;s clusters consisted of separate resource pools customized for the business, which could not be shared with other businesses because the machines in these pools might have separate versions or configurations.</description>

      <description>Facebook has officially announced that it is open sourcing its caching engine, CacheLib, for Web scale services.
CacheLib is described as a pluggable in-process caching engine for collaboratively building and scaling high-performance services.CacheLib&amp;rsquo;s C++ library provides an in-process high-performance caching mechanism that enables developers to build and customize scalable concurrent caches through its simple API, with the built-in ability to transparently leverage DRAM and SSD caches. Also available in the GitHub repository is CacheBench, a benchmarking tool that can be used to evaluate cache performance for different production workloads.</description>

      <description>New technologies take time to develop, but we believe that with continued iteration we can build solutions that support a free and open Internet.
 On Aug. 11, Facebook released a proposal for new privacy-enhancing technology on its website and advocated for a freer and more open Internet, mentioning that the new privacy-enhancing technology aims to protect users&#39; privacy and reduce Internet companies&#39; reliance on personal and third-party data. The new technology will help Internet companies filter the amount of personal information they do not have to process without affecting the way they show ads to people and measure the effectiveness of advertisers&#39; ads.</description>

      <description>Facebook shared yesterday the hardware and software design of its &amp;ldquo;Time Cards&amp;rdquo;, a device used to keep its massive data centers running at peak efficiency. This timekeeping technology, based on extremely accurate atomic clocks and navigation satellites, will ultimately help speed up the various services that operate at the scale of the Internet.
Every computing device needs to know what time it is. With the dimension of time, the device can properly provide various services and record various types of logs; without it backups will fail, financial transactions will go wrong, and many basic network services will not work.</description>
