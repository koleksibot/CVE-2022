      <description>If you have an app, you can increase access speed by more than 15% without any modification. Especially when the network is weak, it can improve access speed by more than 20%. If your App, with frequent switching between 4G and WIFI networks, does not disconnect, does not require reconnection, and has no user perception. If you have an App that needs the security of TLS but also wants the power of HTTP2 multiplexing.</description>

      <title>Why DNS uses the UDP protocol</title>

      <description>The specific issue to be analyzed today is &amp;lsquo;why DNS uses the UDP protocol&amp;rsquo;. DNS acts as a phone book for the entire Internet, translating domain names that can be understood by humans into IP addresses that can be understood by machines, eliminating the need for users of the Internet to have direct access to IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand.
I believe that it is common knowledge among software engineers that DNS uses the UDP protocol, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS uses the UDP protocol to transfer data, but this is not entirely true.</description>

      <title>Why is the UDP header only 8 bytes long?</title>

      <description>The two transport protocols, UDP and TCP, are core members of the IP protocol cluster. The RFC 768, published in 1980, defines the UDP protocol, which allows us to pass data across a network of multiple computer connections. The common DNS protocol can use the UDP protocol to obtain the results of domain name resolution
UDP is the simplest protocol that can transmit data, and its protocol header (also called protocol header) is only 8 bytes.</description>
