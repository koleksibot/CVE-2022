      <description>The pattern of development of most things in the world is similar. In the beginning, relatively general solutions tend to appear to solve most problems, followed by solutions specifically designed for a certain scenario that do not solve general problems but perform extremely well in some specific areas. In the field of computing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are general-purpose and specific solutions, respectively, with the former providing the most basic computing power to solve almost any problem, and the latter excelling in areas such as graphics computing and machine learning.</description>
