      <description>Last week, the Raspberry Pi released its long-awaited 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS, which theoretically allows users to take better advantage of 64-bit processors (newer versions of the Raspberry Pi already have 64-bit processors), support more than 4GB of RAM (the Raspberry Pi 4B comes with up to 8GB of RAM), and perform better when working with multimedia content.
Although this is theoretically true, how do 32-bit and 64-bit perform in actual tests?</description>

      <description>I. Notes In this article, the intranet CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16, that is, all address segment rules and configurations are processed for the current intranet CIDR; clash fake-ip&amp;rsquo;s CIDR is 198.18.0.0/16, please do not write it wrongly as 192, it is 198. II. Installing Clash The transparent proxy method used in this article does not depend on TUN, so it does not matter if it is an enhanced version, please try</description>

      <title>Ubuntu lowers the hardware barrier even further - support for running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB of RAM</title>

      <description>Ubuntu already supports the 4GB and 8GB memory versions of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (supported since Ubuntu 20.10). Now the Ubuntu team plans to lower the hardware barrier for Ubuntu even further by making the upcoming Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with only 2GB RAM.
However, getting a full Linux system like Ubuntu to run properly on a hardware device with too little memory can be difficult, so how does Ubuntu do it?</description>

      <title>Build your own home NAS and streaming server using Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>Network Attached Storage (NAS) provides file-level data access to heterogeneous network users over a computer network. As hard drive prices continue to drop, NAS devices have made their way into the homes of the masses. Leading SMB and home NAS market brands such as Synology range in price from $300 on the low end to $700 on the high end. But if you are a Raspberry Pi player, you can build a very good home NAS and streaming service at about half the cost of the lowest price.</description>
