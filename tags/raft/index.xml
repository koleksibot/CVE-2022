      <description>Distributed Systems and the Consistency Problem The consistency problem is a core problem that needs to be solved in distributed systems. Distributed systems are generally composed of multiple nodes of equal status, and the interaction between the nodes is like several people getting together to discuss a problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a more specific scenario, such as three people discussing where to eat at noon, the first person said that a hot pot restaurant has just opened nearby, and I heard that the taste is very good; but the second person said, no, it takes too long to eat hot pot, or just drink some porridge; and the third person said, I just went to that porridge restaurant yesterday, it&amp;rsquo;s too bad, it&amp;rsquo;s better to go to McDonalds.</description>

      <description>I will mainly list here the Consistent Hash algorithm, Gossip protocol, QuorumNWR algorithm, PBFT algorithm, PoW algorithm, ZAB protocol, and Paxos will be spoken separately. Consistent Hash Algorithm The Consistent Hash algorithm is designed to solve the migration cost of the Hash algorithm. Taking a 10-node cluster as an example, if you add nodes to the cluster, you need to migrate up to 90.91% of the data if you use</description>

      <description>Background When deploying an application that is highly available, we usually place a HAProxy in front of the application so that when any one Server fails, the HAProxy will automatically switch over, but HAProxy also has a single point of failure, so we need more than one HAProxy to ensure that the business is not interrupted, and this time we need another software to work with: Keepalived. Keepalived is only</description>
