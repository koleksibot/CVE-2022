      <description>The Haiku project team has announced the hiring of an existing contributor, waddlesplash, on a full-time basis to work on the overall improvements to Haiku. The contract was signed on 23 August 2021 and waddlesplash has been working on Haiku since Tuesday.
Haiku has hired contributors as contractors for specific projects, such as package systems or work on WebKit and WebPositive browsers, but this is the first time someone has been hired in a more open position to work on overall improvements.</description>

      <description>On August 18, 2021, the Haiku project turns 20 years old. 20 years ago, an email with the headline &amp;ldquo;Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s start&amp;rdquo; inspired many developers and thus brought together the first Haiku team to save, maintain and grow BeOS.
BeOS is an operating system developed by Be for multimedia use, using the then-advanced 64-bit BeFS file system, supporting multiprocessors, and with excellent multimedia performance. beOS&#39; GUI follows clear and clean design principles, and its API is written in C++, making it very easy to program.</description>
