      <description>Raspberry Pi is the most popular single-board computer ever made. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as desktops, home media centers, smart Wi-Fi routers, automation systems, and gaming servers. The use cases are endless.
If your Raspberry Pi does NOT have an SD card with NOOBS pre-installed, you will need to manually install the OS on the SD card. You can run many different operating systems on your Raspberry Pi, including Windows 10 IoT, FreeBSD, and various Linux distributions such as Arch Linux and Raspbian .</description>

      <description>Ubuntu already supports the 4GB and 8GB memory versions of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (supported since Ubuntu 20.10). Now the Ubuntu team plans to lower the hardware barrier for Ubuntu even further by making the upcoming Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with only 2GB RAM.
However, getting a full Linux system like Ubuntu to run properly on a hardware device with too little memory can be difficult, so how does Ubuntu do it?</description>

      <description>The blog was previously deployed on Ali cloud and was about to expire, so I migrated the server to Tencent cloud for the Double 11 event. At the same time, we intend to change the operating system for deployment, and replace the original CentOS 7.4 with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The rest of the environment is basically the same, still using Nginx + MariaDB + phpMyAdmin + Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt as before,</description>

      <description>The official release of Windows 11 is less than a month away (October 5), which is about a week before the release of Ubuntu 21.10 (codenamed &amp;ldquo;Impish Indri&amp;rdquo;), which is on October 14. What will be the performance difference between these two upcoming OS releases?
Phoronix recently published a performance test comparing Ubuntu 21.10 with Windows 10/11.

      <description>Omgubuntu sources indicate that Bq, the company behind the first retail Ubuntu phone, declared bankruptcy earlier this year.
According to the description, Spanish hardware company Bq (also known as Bq Readers) had some success by selling a range of Android phones and tablets in Europe. Bq is a Spanish branded company, but its hardware is made in China.
However, the response to the first Bq Ubuntu phones has not been enthusiastic.</description>
