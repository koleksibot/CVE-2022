      <description>Microsoft Edge vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman revealed that the team is experimenting with a new feature in Edge that disables the JavaScript JIT compiler to enable some additional security protection. They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>
