      <description>GitHub has officially announced that the engineering team responsible for github.com has migrated its development environment to Codespaces.
GitHub.com&amp;rsquo;s codebase is nearly 14 years old. When the first commit of github.com was pushed, Rails was only two years old, AWS was only a year old, and Azure and GCP were not yet available. In those 14 years, GitHub.com&amp;rsquo;s core repository (github/github) has received over a million commits, the vast majority of which have come from developers building and testing on macOS.</description>
