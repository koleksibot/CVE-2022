      <description>SSL protocol is an important part of modern network communication, which provides data security at the transport layer. In order to facilitate your understanding, this article will start with the basics of cryptography, and then move on to a detailed explanation of the SSL protocol principles, processes and some important features, and finally will expand on the differences between the national SSL protocols, security and the key new features of TLS 1.</description>

      <title>Nine years on, what has TLS 1.3 brought?</title>

      <description>Nine years after the release of TLS 1.2, and four long years of agreement on it, TLS 1.3 is now available, designed with the simple goal of making data transfers faster and more secure.
More secure TLS uses a hybrid encryption process, which means that symmetric encryption is used during communication and the key for that encryption is negotiated through asymmetric encryption. The MAC algorithm is used for integrity checking and the certificate system is used for authentication.</description>

      <description>With the popularity of HTTPS, the word TLS also appears more frequently, so what is TLS and how does TLS make HTTP transmission secure?
TLS (Transport Layer Security), formerly known as SSL (Secure Socket Layer), is located between TCP and the application layer. Compared to HTTP, HTTPS does not change the protocol itself, but adds a layer of TLS between TCP and HTTP for encryption to ensure information security.
For information transmitted in clear text, there are several risks</description>

      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>
