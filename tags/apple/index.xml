      <description>On the morning of January 8, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled &amp;ldquo;Why Apple&amp;rsquo;s iMessage Is Winning: Teens Dread the Green Text Bubble, which pointedly pointed out some of the problems with Apple&amp;rsquo;s iMessage instant messaging application: Apple users use the blue text bubble by default in iMessage, and because Apple forces Andriod devices to use SMS (short message service) instead of sending messages over network data, Android devices are not able to send messages over the network.</description>

      <description>Alyssa Rosenzweig, one of the Asahi Linux developers working on porting Linux to the Apple M1, recently shared a milestone on her social media platforms: namely, that she successfully booted the Debian distribution on an Apple M1 device and into the GNOME Shell desktop environment.
It is worth noting, however, that OpenGL graphics acceleration is not yet supported. The experience currently relies solely on LLVMpipe, a software implementation of Mesa Gallium3D for accelerating OpenGL on the CPU, to achieve the OpenGL acceleration required by the GNOME desktop.</description>
