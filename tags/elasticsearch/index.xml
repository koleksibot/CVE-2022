      <description>This article documents the use of Filebeat, Kibana, and Elasticsearch to build a system for collecting and analyzing Nginx logs; Filebeat is responsible for delivering Nginx log data as a data source to Elasticsearch. As an introduction, we will first explain the relationship between the software: Elasticsearch is a distributed full-text search and data analysis engine based on RESTful style; Kibana is a web system for visualizing Elasticsearch data; and</description>

      <description>Elastic announced has settled a dispute with Amazon over trademark infringement of the term &amp;quot; Elasticsearc&amp;quot; trademark infringement lawsuit with Amazon. In accordance with the resolution, Amazon has begun removing the term Elasticsearch from various pages of its website and from the names of its services and related items. Now, the only Elasticsearch service available on AWS and AWS Marketplace is Elastic Cloud.
In January 2021, Elastic announced change Elasticsearch and Kibana Open Source License Agreement; because they believe that customers are being misled by Amazon&amp;rsquo;s offering of Amazon Elasticsearch and that Amazon is abusing the open source license and profiting from the project.</description>

      <description>Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multi-tenant-enabled, full-text search engine with an HTTP Web interface and schemaless JSON documents.Elasticsearch is developed in Java and distributed as open source software under the Apache license. The official client is available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy, Ruby, and many other languages.
After nearly three years, Elasticsearch 8 has been released with the following new features.</description>

      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>In this section we will install and configure Filebeat to collect log data from a Kubernetes cluster and send it to ElasticSearch, Filebeat is a lightweight log collection agent that can also be configured with specific modules to parse and visualize the log format of applications (e.g., databases, Nginx, etc.).
Similar to Metricbeat, Filebeat requires a configuration file to set the link information to ElasticSearch, the connection to Kibana, and the way logs are collected and parsed.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will use Metricbeat to monitor Kubernetes clusters, as we have already installed and configured the ElasticSearch cluster in the previous article. Metricbeat is a lightweight collector on the server that is used to collect monitoring metrics for hosts and services on a regular basis. This is the first part of our build of Kubernetes full-stack monitoring. Metribeat collects system metrics by default, but also includes a</description>

      <description>In this series of articles, we will learn how to use the Elastic technology stack to build a monitoring environment for Kubernetes. The goal of observability is to provide an operations tool for production environments to detect when a service is unavailable (e.g., if the service is down, has errors, or is slow to respond) and to keep some troubleshooting information to help us pinpoint the problem. In summary, there</description>

      <description>AWS announced that it is changing the name of its cloud service offering, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, to Amazon OpenSearch Service, and claims that despite the name change, they will continue to provide the same experience and will not have any negative impact on ongoing operations and development methods, as well as business usage.
OpenSearch is a community-driven open source search and analytics suite forked from Elasticsearch 7.10.2 and Kibana 7.10.2 licensed from Apache 2.</description>

      <description>In response to the cloud service provider, Elastic recently made changes to the official Python client for its Elasticsearch database (Elasticsearch-py) to make it incompatible with the forks, and then brutally shut down comments on the topic on GitHub. This action caused a heated discussion among developers.
Sword pointing to cloud vendors Elasticsearch is a database manager and analytics engine that is widely used in the industry. The official client is available in Java, .</description>
