      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones are carrying more and more features, and naturally users need more and more storage space. But for users with low-end phones, storage space is stretched to the limit, and they often need to uninstall apps that are already installed on their phones in order to install some new apps, thus freeing up space on their phones.
Google brought the feature of uninstalling unused apps to Android a few years ago, which prompts users to uninstall apps they haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a long time to free up space when the phone is running low.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction In Android window management, all windows are organized in a tree data structure, and knowing the tree of WMS helps us understand the management and display of windows. At the same time, the hierarchy of WMS also determines the hierarchy of SurfaceFlinger, which determines its display rules. 2.

      <description>1. Introduction As more and more large and folding screen devices appear, many applications do not have UI adaptations for devices of different sizes, when the application chooses to display in a specific aspect ratio (although Google does not recommend this, the official hope that developers can adapt the layout of different screen sizes ~), when the application&amp;rsquo;s aspect ratio and its container ratio is not compatible, it will be</description>

      <description>1. Introduction OverScroller in Android is responsible for calculating the real-time sliding position for ListView, RecyclerView, ScrollView and other scrolling controls, and these position algorithms directly affect the experience of each scroll. As we all know, Android&amp;rsquo;s animation experience is ~far~ inferior to iOS, and even now that Android generally supports 120Hz high swipe, the experience is not very comfortable. The reason for this is no longer hardware performance limitations,</description>

      <description>Developer Mishaal Rahaman broke the news on social media platforms that he found a series of code changes in AOSP that highlight that Google is trying to shorten the CPU frequency by boosting game load times. Specifically, they are developing a new API that will allow games to communicate their current state to the OS. If the game takes time to load, the OS will send a command; the CPU will then run at a higher frequency, thus reducing the game load time.</description>

      <description>APP Wakeup and Scene Restoration In App launch promotion, waking up users is a common operation strategy. To get users active again and convert their behavior, the path of users must be restored from the scene to find the mystery of user growth from the root. In this era of advertising, I believe most users have encountered a similar scenario when using an app: when using an information app, they</description>

      <description>Widgets have been an important part of Android since 2008 and are an important aspect of customising the home screen. You can think of a widget as an &amp;lsquo;at-a-glance&amp;rsquo; view of the app, giving the user a glimpse of the app&amp;rsquo;s data and core functionality without having to open the app from the home screen. But the AppWidget API has remained largely unchanged since the launch of Android, with only</description>

      <description>On the morning of January 8, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled &amp;ldquo;Why Apple&amp;rsquo;s iMessage Is Winning: Teens Dread the Green Text Bubble, which pointedly pointed out some of the problems with Apple&amp;rsquo;s iMessage instant messaging application: Apple users use the blue text bubble by default in iMessage, and because Apple forces Andriod devices to use SMS (short message service) instead of sending messages over network data, Android devices are not able to send messages over the network.</description>

      <description>For the black industry of APP, we mentioned that some users will bypass the wind control strategy by changing IP. A more convenient way to change IP is to use proxy IP or VPN. In testing APP security is required to make a judgment on whether to use the code and VPN. The following is a compilation of some codes for reference. Android determine whether to use proxy IP 1</description>

      <description>Starting in September, Microsoft will no longer support its Android Office apps on Chromebooks. Instead, Microsoft will recommend that these users use its web-based Office.com and Outlook.com apps from 18 September.
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s suite of Office apps arrived on Android devices back in 2015, and regular updates since then have brought a host of new features to the apps. After this date, Microsoft will continue to offer native Office apps for other Android devices, a move that is just one of the limitations Microsoft has placed on Chrome OS.</description>

      <description>SurfaceView is a special kind of view in Android. The biggest difference between it and TextView and Button is that it is not on the same view layer as its view container, and its UI display can be done in a separate thread, so the drawing of SurfaceView does not affect the main thread. surfaceView does not affect the main thread. Combining these features, SurfaceView is generally used to implement dynamic or complex images and animations.</description>
