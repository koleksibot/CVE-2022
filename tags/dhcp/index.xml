      <description>Yesterday, I was working with a colleague to troubleshoot a problem with a VM IP change, so I just wanted to organize the DHCP lease life cycle and the change process.
DHCP lease lifecycle  Allocation: A client starts with no valid lease, and therefore no DHCP-assigned address. It acquires a lease through an allocation process. Reallocation: If a client already has an address from an existing lease, then when it reboots or starts up after shutdown, it contacts the DHCP server that granted it the lease to confirm the lease and obtain operational parameters.</description>
