      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
 etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>
