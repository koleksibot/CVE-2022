Deno Deploy In the summer of 2021, Deno Deploy released its first Beta version, a modern serverless cloud built from the ground up by the Deno team that allows users to very quickly deploy JavaScript, TypeScript, and WASM services to data centers around the world.</description>

      <description>Deno&amp;rsquo;s compatibility data can now be found in the compatibility chart on MDN. The official blog notes that Deno embraces modern Web APIs, and they believe that when features are added to runtime, it is best to do so in the form of Web APIs. This is both good for developers, who are already familiar with these APIs, and good for Deno, who can leverage existing tests.
The Web API has a huge amount of documentation, and a search for &amp;ldquo;fetch javascript&amp;rdquo; yields hundreds of millions of results.</description>
