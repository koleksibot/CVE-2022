      <description>1. Why Asynchronous Programming JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language that can only execute one task at a time. In order to handle different task scheduling logic, asynchronous programming is unavoidable in JavaScript development. The following scenarios necessarily involve asynchronous programming methods. IO operations: external device access File access TCP / UDP network access Asynchronous APIs setTimeout / setInterval setImmediate process.nextTick queueMicrotask Event 2. Several ways to implement asynchronous programming</description>

      <title>Microsoft proposes to add type annotation to JavaScript natively</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/microsoft-type-annotations-for-javascript/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/microsoft-type-annotations-for-javascript/</guid>
      <description>Microsoft has put forward a new proposal to bring an optional type syntax to JavaScript, which could make JavaScript natively come with some of the features of TypeScript, making the TypeScript language faster and easier to use.
Specifically, the proposal calls for Type Annotations to be added to JavaScript code, allowing type annotations to be checked by external type checkers. At runtime, the JavaScript engine would ignore these annotations and treat these types as annotations.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/js-mapping-tables/</guid>
      <description>The common data collections in JavaScript are lists (Array) and mapping tables (Plain Object). This article talks about mapping tables. Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, the object itself is a mapping table, and the &amp;ldquo;attribute name ⇒ attribute value&amp;rdquo; of an object is the &amp;ldquo;key ⇒ value&amp;rdquo; in the mapping table. To make it easier to use the object as a mapping table, JavaScript even allows property names</description>

      <description>The this problem is one of the most complex problems in JavaScript, and even experienced programmers can inadvertently fall into the this keyword pit. Whenever a function is defined, this is automatically defined inside the function (even if the this keyword is not used inside the function).

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/ieee754/</guid>
      <description>Years ago when I was studying C++ at university, I learned that IEEE 754 is the most common way of representing floating point numbers in computers today. But since I work with it very little, I often forget the specific details of this standard, so I wrote this article to document it in detail.
How do you represent numbers? There are many ways to represent numbers. For example, the most common way we use when writing - fixing the position of the decimal point, placing a decimal point in the middle of several numbers to represent a decimal, or a whole number if there is no decimal point.</description>

      <description>We all know that garbage collection (GC) is important for modern application development. It depends on your programming language and many developers have little idea how it is done.
Garbage collection always releases memory that is no longer in use. The strategies and algorithms to achieve this vary from one language to another. For example, JavaScript does this in some interesting ways, depending on whether you&amp;rsquo;re on a browser or a Node.</description>

      <description>The StateOfJS 2021 State of JavaScript Survey reports that JavaScript is in a much better state than it was in 2016. When the first State of JS survey was conducted, TypeScript usage was only 21%; today it is 69%. This is followed by Elm at 2.4 percent, Flow at 1.7 percent, and CoffeeScript at 1.4 percent.
The report was actually delayed to 2022 due to the large number of matters in 2021.</description>

      <description>When we use front-end rendering like Vue or React, there are usually two types of routing: hash routing and history routing. hash routing: listen to the hash changes in the url and render different content, this kind of routing does not send requests to the server and does not need server-side support. history routing: listens for changes in the path in the url and requires the support of both the</description>

      <description>We know that js is single-threaded, so how does js handle asynchronous code? For example, the following code is how the output is performed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 console.log(1); setTimeout(function() { console.log(2); }, 0); new Promise(function(resolve) { console.log(3); resolve(Date.now()); }).then(function() { console.log(4); }); console.log(5); setTimeout(function() { new Promise(function(resolve) { console.log(6); resolve(Date.now()); }).then(function() { console.log(7); });</description>

      <description>During development, our goal is 0error, 0warning. But there are many factors beyond our control, and to avoid errors in one piece of code that affect other modules or the overall code, we often use the try-catch module to actively catch some exceptions or errors. For example, if we get the parameters in the url and parse them in JSON, we need to wrap them in try-catch because we can&amp;rsquo;t</description>

      <description>Proxy is a syntax added to the es2015 standard specification, and it is likely that you have only heard of it but not used it - after all, Proxy features cannot be used easily given the compatibility issues. But now, with each browser&amp;rsquo;s update iteration, Proxy&amp;rsquo;s support is getting higher and higher. Vue3 has replaced Object.defineProperty with Proxy for responsiveness, and mobx has been using Proxy for proxying since version</description>

      <description>The need for cross-tab communication is common in scenarios where there is a lot of content to browse or manipulate (e.g. blogs or CMS systems) and data consistency needs to be maintained. Most of these scenarios can be solved by bringing in a back-end service to keep the data consistent across multiple tabs by polling and so on.

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/use-callback-misunderstanding/</guid>
      <description>useCallback takes a callback function and an array of dependencies as arguments, and returns the cached callback function if each item in the dependency array remains the same.
Since useCallback can cache functions, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t all functions in the Function component be wrapped in useCallback for the purpose of React application optimization? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at two examples and decide which one is better, App1 or App2?
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  const App1 = () =&amp;gt; { const [value, setValue] = useState(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;); const onValueChange = useCallback( (event: React.</description>

Think back to how we normally manipulate cookies. For example, if you want to retrieve a cookie, you have to parse it manually to get the value of a cookie because document.cookie returns a string that is the union of all cookies.

Preface So far in front-end development, asynchronous problems have experienced the despair of Callback Hell, the normative melee of Promise/Deffered, the invincibility of Generator, and now the acceptance of Async/Await by the public, in which Promise and Async/Await are still active in code. Their perceptions and evaluations have been reversed many times, and they have their own fans, creating a love-hate relationship that continues to this day, and the</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re interesting, and a bit complicated. They played an important role in web programming before concurrency was widely used. Before that, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some basic concepts.

      <description>Helps you distinguish between encodeURI and encodeURIComponent usage scenarios
Background Recently, while working on the preview feature in my company, I came across a scenario of encoding the request parameters. So the question arises.
 Why is it necessary to encode a link or parameter? When do I need to encode? What is the difference between * encodeURI and encodeURIComponent?  Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at it together~
Why do you need to encode Http protocol parameter transmission is &amp;ldquo;key=value&amp;rdquo; such key-value pairs, if you want to pass more than one parameter you need to use the &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; symbol to split the key-value pairs.</description>

This article, based on StackOverflow, compiles five ways for JavaScript to detect mobile browsers. navigator.userAgent The easiest way to do this is to analyze the browser&amp;rsquo;s user agent string, which contains device information. JS gets this string through the navigator.userAgent property, and as long as it contains keywords like mobi, android, iphone, etc.,</description>

      <description>When does WeakMap work? First of all, we must understand that even without WeakMap, the world of JS is also running as usual, WeakMap in the JS world, and its name is the same - &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo;, weak. Belong to the kind of role, but not in the key position to do great things, somewhat similar to some CSS function selector, although simpler and more convenient to use, but usually use</description>

      <description>What is babel? babel is a Javascript compiler, one of the most commonly used tools for front-end development today, primarily for converting ECMAScript 2015+ versions of code to backward-compatible JavaScript syntax so that it can run in current and older versions of browsers or other environments.

      <description>1. Origin of the problem One sign of understanding the JavaScript language is to understand the following two ways of writing, which may have different results.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  var obj = { foo: function () {} }; var foo = obj.foo; // Writing Method I obj.foo() // Writing Method 2 foo()   In the above code, although obj.foo and foo point to the same function, the execution result may be different.</description>

      <description>In multi-page web applications, you will encounter scenarios of inter-page interaction, such as: passing data from navigation pages to iFrame pages, notifying events between tab pages, and so on.
This article introduces two common interfaces for inter-page interaction - window.postMessage and BroadcastChannel API - and compares the differences between them.
Messaging Direction window.postMessage An example of a window.postMessage call is as follows.

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-07/web-worker-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview The JavaScript language uses a single-threaded model, which means that all tasks can only be done on one thread, one thing at a time. If the previous task is not done, the later task has to wait. With the increase in computing power of computers, especially with the advent of multi-core CPUs, single-threading poses a great inconvenience and cannot fully utilize the computing power of computers.
The role of the Web Worker is to create a multi-threaded environment for JavaScript, allowing the main thread to create Worker threads and assign some tasks to the latter to run.</description>

      <description>If you know Haskell, you are familiar with the following expressions
1 2 3  repeat 1 -- =&amp;gt; [1, 1, 1, 1, 1,...]  cycle &amp;#34;abc&amp;#34; -- =&amp;gt; &amp;#34;abcabcabc...&amp;#34;  [1, 3..] -- =&amp;gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, ...]   Several of the above expressions produce infinite lists. For those of you who are used to mainstream programming voices may be confused as to how the concept of infinity can be expressed inside a finite amount of memory.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to write JavaScript scripts to send user data back to the server.
I made a code repository containing all the examples below, which can be run to see the results.
1. Synchronization AJAX The common practice of sending data back to the server is to put the collected user data inside the unload event and send it back to the server with an AJAX request.
However, asynchronous AJAX inside the unload event may not always work, because the page is already in unload and the browser may or may not send it.</description>

      <description>Components are the direction of front-end development, and the popular React and Vue are both component frameworks. Google has been pushing for native components for browsers due to its mastery of the Chrome browser, namely the Web Components API. Compared to third-party frameworks, native components are simple and straightforward, intuitive, don&amp;rsquo;t have to load any external modules, and have a small amount of code. It is still evolving, but is</description>

      <description>I recently came across a small knowledge point during development. Here is a Base64 encoded image that I want to copy into the system pasteboard, how can I solve this?
For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.
Q: Now I have an image in this format, how can I copy it into the system pasteboard?</description>

      <description>fetch() is an upgraded version of XMLHttpRequest used to make HTTP requests inside JavaScript scripts.
The browser provides this object natively. This article describes its usage in detail.
1. Basic usage The function of fetch() is basically the same as XMLHttpRequest, but with three main differences.
 fetch() uses Promise and does not use a callback function, so it is much simpler to write and more concise. The modular design of fetch(), with API spread over multiple objects (Response object, Request object, Headers object), is more reasonable; in contrast, the API design of XMLHttpRequest is not very good, with input, output and state all managed in the same interface, making it easy to write very confusing code.</description>
