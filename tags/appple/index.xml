      <description>Apple has recently made an announcement for RISV developers.
Apple is currently seeking developers with detailed knowledge of and experience with the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and ARM&amp;rsquo;s Neon vector ISA for the Vector and Numerics Group (VaNG) group within its core operating systems team, the job announcement states. Apple&amp;rsquo;s VaNG group is responsible for developing and improving various embedded subsystems running on iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.
Apple, which is known for its secrecy, did not reveal in the job posting what it intends to do with RISC-V, but the job description indicates that the developer in this role will need to be responsible for machine learning, computational vision and natural language processing.</description>
