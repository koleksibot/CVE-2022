      <description>According to a report in The Register, Microsoft has announced a public preview of Visual Studio Code for the Web in a deleted (and presumably premature) article.
Visual Studio Code for the Web, the web version of Visual Studio Code, is described as a new web-based code editor that runs entirely in the browser. Anyone can use VS Code for the Web for free at https://vscode.dev to quickly open and browse source code hosted on GitHub and local computers (with support for Azure Repositories to follow) and make lightweight changes.</description>

One of the biggest changes to the Microsoft Store in Windows 11 is the support for uploading apps to the App Store, as long as they run on Windows.</description>
