      <description>1. Background and pre-requisites The Btrfs file system is a younger file system than Ext4, with more playable features such as support for snapshots, subvolumes, checksums and self-tests, soft RAID and even transparent compression.
However, it is recommended not to use Btrfs file system without O&amp;amp;M capability. This article documents the process of reading data after removing the disk from the Btrfs file system under a Synology DSM system.
In my DSM system, there are two hard disks forming a RAID1 array, using the Btrfs file system.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that almost everyone loves unity, and having a unified development experience is something that developers have always strived for and welcomed.
Development environments have long been tightly coupled with specific technologies, such as Visual Studio, for primarily .NET-based development. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen heated debates among developers who endlessly argue for one tool over another. This will never end, nor should it, because many times these arguments result in the awesome tools we are using today.</description>

      <title>Why MAC addresses do not need to be globally unique</title>

      <description>MAC address (Media access control address) is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface controller (NIC), it will be used as a network address in the network segment, all hosts with a network card have a separate MAC address, the address contains a total of 48 bits, occupying A normal MAC address is represented in the format shown below, using two hexadecimal digits for each byte.
1  6e:77:0f:b8:8b:6b   Because MAC addresses need to be unique, IEEE assigns address segments based on the manufacturer of the device.</description>

      <title>Why Linux and macOS don&#39;t need defragmentation</title>

      <description>I believe that many software engineers today use Linux or macOS systems, and unlike Windows, we hardly see the concept of disk defragmentation. From personal experience, the author has not defragmented a disk in macOS for the past seven or eight years, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any related operations in today&amp;rsquo;s disk tools, only the diskutil command to set whether a disk is defragmented on or off.
Windows operating systems may need to defragment their disks every once in a while, and there are two reasons behind this problem: one is that Windows uses a very simple file system called FAT, which is designed in such a way that the same files may be scattered in different locations on the disk, and the other is that solid state drives were not popular in the ancient times and mechanical hard drives have poor random read and write performance.</description>

      <description>A computer&amp;rsquo;s file system is a method of storing and organizing computer data, which makes it easy to access and find. A file system uses the abstract logical concept of files and tree directories instead of using the concept of data blocks for physical devices such as hard disks and CD-ROMs, so that users using a file system to save data do not have to care about how much data is actually saved on the hard disk (or CD-ROM) at the address of the data block, but only need to You only need to remember the directory and file name of the file.</description>
