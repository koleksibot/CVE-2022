      <description>Recently the Swift community released an announcement that in order to further provide interoperability support between Swift and C++, they formed the Swift and C++ Interoperability Working Group as part of the Swift project. The role of this new working group is to develop and design an interoperability model between C++ and Swift developed by Apple.
In the announcement, Swift developer Alex Lorenz said that the reason for the Swift and C++ Working Group is that there is already significant developer interest in bi-directional interoperability between the two languages.</description>
