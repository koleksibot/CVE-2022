      <description>Recently, user na-an discovered that when opening a folder with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s VSCode editor, many empty files with invalid code are automatically created in the directory. The user then posted a related issue to the VSCode GitHub repository, which randomly sparked a lively discussion, with many users saying they were also suffering from the bug.
Some of the file names are short, some are long, and the names of these files are not valid unicode, for example \312\316\361 in the figure is octal.</description>

      <description>As I am recently studying envoy project, which is a cpp project, for me this cpp newcomer is still more pressure, feel everywhere is a pit, open a guide article to record. If you want to study the envoy project source code, it is definitely necessary to jump to the code, but if you open it with clion, then you will find that envoy is built with bazel, no CMakeLists.txt</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that almost everyone loves unity, and having a unified development experience is something that developers have always strived for and welcomed.
Development environments have long been tightly coupled with specific technologies, such as Visual Studio, for primarily .NET-based development. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen heated debates among developers who endlessly argue for one tool over another. This will never end, nor should it, because many times these arguments result in the awesome tools we are using today.</description>
