      <description>Disk for persistent storage is not a scarce resource today, but CPU and memory are still relatively expensive resources, and this article will describe how memory, a scarce resource in computers, is managed.
Memory management systems and modules play an important role in operating systems and programming languages. The use of any resource is inseparable from the two actions of requesting and releasing, and two important processes in memory management are memory allocation and garbage collection, and how a memory management system can use limited memory resources to provide services to as many programs or modules as possible is its core goal.</description>
