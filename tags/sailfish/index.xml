      <description>Jolla is a Finnish startup founded in 2011 and probably better known by the name Sailfish OS, the operating system it develops. After 10 years in business, Jolla has recently announced that it has become profitable, reaching an important milestone in the history of the company, which was founded by a group of employees who left Nokia in order to develop a Linux-based alternative to Android.
Describing 2020 as a &amp;ldquo;turning point&amp;rdquo; for the company&amp;rsquo;s business, Jolla reported 53% year-on-year revenue growth and 34% EBITDA (earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation) in 2020.</description>
