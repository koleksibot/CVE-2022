      <description>After the author of Faker.js emptied the project&amp;rsquo;s repository code, another software author has been disappointed that companies have used his open source project without giving anything back. on January 11, Christofer Dutz, creator of Apache PLC4X, posted on GitHub, stating that he will stop providing free community support to corporate users of PLC4X due to the lack of any form of return. If no company is willing to step forward to fund the project, he will cease maintenance and any form of support for PLC4X.</description>
