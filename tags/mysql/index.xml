      <title>Some minor issues with LIKE fuzzy lookups in MySQL</title>

      <description>Today, a colleague found a bug in MySQL regarding fuzzy lookups, which is quite embarrassing to say the least. When I saw the problem, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what I had written wrong.
The problem was that I meant to find rows in the database starting with abc_, but I ended up with a statement that looked like the following
1  SELECT*FROMusers_tabWHEREnameLIKE&amp;#39;abc_%&amp;#39;;  Can you find the desired results this way?</description>

      <description>MySQL INSERT INTO Statement The CREATE TABLE statement enables you to create columns, while the INSERT statement enables you to insert rows or records into a table.The INSERT statement is an example of the Data Manipulation Language (DML). As the name implies, data manipulation language deals with data manipulation.

      <description>Why MySQL uses B+ trees is a question that often comes up in interviews. Many people may have some understanding of this question, but most answers are incomplete and inaccurate, and most people simply talk about the difference between B+ and B trees. But none of them really answer the question of why MySQL chooses to use B+ trees. In this article, we will analyze in depth some of the reasons behind MySQL&amp;rsquo;s choice of B+ trees.</description>

      <title>Why does the database lose data</title>

      <description>Database management systems are an important part of software today. Open source databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and commercial Oracle are everywhere, and almost all services rely on database management systems to store data.
It sounds like a matter of course that a database will not lose data, and persistence capability should be the most basic guarantee of a database, but in this complex world it is very difficult to guarantee that data will not be lost.</description>

      <title>Why MySQL&#39;s self-incrementing primary keys are not monotonic or continuous</title>

      <description>When we work with relational databases, the primary key is a concept that cannot be avoided. The primary key acts as an identifier for a record, and we can locate a unique record in a table by its identifier.
In a relational database, we choose the smallest subset of multiple fields in a record as the unique identifier for that record in the table. Depending on the definition of a primary key in a relational database, we can choose either a single column as the primary key or multiple columns as the primary key, but the primary key must exist and be unique throughout the record.</description>

      <description>There are already many articles on the web comparing PostgreSQL with MySQL, this article is just to sort out some important information. Before we start our analysis, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at these two charts.
MySQL

      <title>MySQL Storage Engines MyISAM, InnoDB</title>

      <description>In the process of using MySQL, I have some questions about the concepts of MyISAM and InnoDB, and what is the difference between the two engines has always been a question in my mind. In order to solve this puzzle, I searched the web and found the following information.
MyISAM is the default database engine of MySQL (before version 5.5), improved by the earlier ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method). Although the performance is excellent, it has one drawback: it does not support transaction.</description>

      <title>MySQL High Performance Storage Engine TokuDB</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/tokudb/</link>

      <description>When installing MariaDB, I learned about TokuDB, which replaces InnoDB, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see the introduction.
What is TokuDB? The most popular MySQL engine that supports full transactions is INNODB, which is characterized by the fact that the data itself is organized by B-TREE, which is a huge B-TREE index clustered by primary key. So at this point, the write speed will be somewhat reduced, because to write each time to use an IO to do the index tree rearrangement.</description>

      <title>MySQL Crash Safe</title>

      <description>The MySQL master-slave architecture has been widely used, and the stability of the master-slave replication relationship is a constant concern.
MySQL 5.6 provides a new feature for master-slave replication stability: slave support crash-safe. This feature can solve the problem of relay_log.info bit inaccuracy caused by abnormal power failure in previous versions.
In this article, we will introduce this feature in terms of principle, parameters, and new issues.
