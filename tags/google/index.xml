      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s self-developed Fuchsia operating system is now available as a full Chrome browser experience, a further step towards widespread deployment, according to tech media outlet 9to5Google.
Previously, users have had very limited access to the web on Fuchsia for some time now through the operating system&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Simple Browser&amp;rdquo; app (powered by the Chromium engine). But even so, the &amp;ldquo;browser&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t offer some of the daily necessities such as the address bar or tabs.</description>

      <description>research from Google&amp;rsquo;s security research team, Project Zero, shows that Linux developers are more effective at fixing security vulnerabilities more quickly than anyone else (including Google).
From 2019 to 2021, Project Zero reported a total of 376 issues to vendors within the standard 90-day period.]351 (93.4%) of these bugs have been fixed, 14 (3.7%) have been flagged by the vendor as WontFix, and 11 (2.9%) remain unfixed. At the time of the bulletin, 8 had sometimes passed their fix deadlines; the remaining 3 were still within their fix deadlines.</description>

      <description>oogle recently posted official blog that their Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) continued to grow in 2021, with a total of $8.7 million in vulnerability awards. A total of $8.7 million in vulnerability awards were made, with researchers who found vulnerabilities also donating $300,000 of their awards to charity.
Android For Android vulnerability rewards, researchers are being paid twice as much in 2021 compared to 2020. In concrete terms, researchers received nearly $3 million in 2021, and Google also awarded the largest single Android vulnerability bounty ever &amp;ndash; $157,000!</description>

      <title>Google announces abandonment of FLoC, launch of alternative Topics API</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/google-topics-api/</link>

      <description>FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) is a controversial project launched by Google last year, which replaces the original cookies-based ad tracking by dividing users into different user groups in order to protect users&#39; privacy while displaying ads.
But FLoC has been met with industry resistance since its announcement, with EFF arguing that the project has failed to deliver on Google&amp;rsquo;s claims of privacy protection. Vivaldi and Brave, browsers that use Chromium, have said they will disable the feature, and GitHub and WordPress will also disable FLoC on their sites.</description>

      <title>Golang Common Design Patterns - Option Pattern</title>

      <description>As any developer familiar with Python knows, Python has default parameters that allow us to optionally override certain default parameters as needed when instantiating an object to determine how to instantiate the object. This feature is great for elegantly simplifying code when an object has multiple default arguments.
The Go language does not syntactically support default parameters, so in order to create objects both by default parameters and by passing custom parameters, we need to use some programming tricks to achieve this.</description>

      <description>Introduction to the GFS system Google File System (abbreviated as GFS or GoogleFS), a proprietary distributed file system developed by Google Inc.
It differs from traditional file systems in that it is.
 Distributed - provides a high degree of horizontal scalability Networked using a large number of inexpensive common machines - allows for single machine failure No Random Write - does not allow arbitrary changes to existing files  Google did not release the software part of the system as open source software.</description>

      <description>Recently looked up some old Google articles / papers, found that Google has a number of systems on the design of the text are written planet scale, the breath that is really big. When you think about it, FAANG can do business to the global Internet companies, in addition to these five, there are not many other, they do have the capital to blow planet scale. Really envious.
Google&amp;rsquo;s employees came out to start a business, the company name is also TailScale (seems to be doing vpn&amp;rsquo;s), PlanetScale (this seems to be taking vitess out to start a business) so that means ex-googler is also more like the culture of this company.</description>

      <description>Microsoft has earlier launched the preview version of Windows 11, which has many changes in the overall UI and experience compared to Windows 10. While some of the changes have been welcomed by users and Microsoft partners, others have sparked dissatisfaction from other vendors and users. Now Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s changes to how users can change their default browser in Windows 11 have sparked dissatisfaction from its competitors such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Vivaldi.</description>

      <description>Google recently released an end-to-end neural audio codec &amp;ndash; SoundStream. Most importantly, Google says this is the world&amp;rsquo;s first audio codec powered by a neural network and supporting different sound types such as voice, music and ambient sounds, which can process the above-mentioned kinds of audio in real time on a smartphone&amp;rsquo;s processor.
Audio codecs are essential tools for compressing audio files in order to make them smaller and save as much time as possible during transmission.</description>

      <description>Today, security vulnerabilities are increasingly plaguing large open source projects. According to RiskSense statistics, the number of open source software vulnerabilities more than doubled in 2019 compared to 2018. Considering that nearly 91 percent of commercial applications contain outdated or deprecated open source components, the impact of security vulnerabilities is far-reaching.
As a member of the open source software community, Google is well aware of the growing threat to open source projects posed by software supply chain attacks, and Allstar is its latest tool to improve security.</description>

      <title>Google Microsoft teams up for major update to Chromium&#39;s virtual keyboard</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-08/ms-google-on-a-big-keyboard-update-for-chrome/</guid>
      <description>Microsoft and Google are working on a new API for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge called &amp;ldquo;VirtualKeyboard&amp;rdquo; that updates the on-screen keyboard for typing on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Android and provides better control.
According to the documentation, Virtual Keyboard (VK) is a public JavaScript API that puts control of the on-screen keyboard in the hands of Web developers. As it stands now, developers have very limited control over VK, and the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s performance is not ideal for scenarios where developers want users to use a website&amp;rsquo;s built-in keyboard to enter passwords on Android.</description>

      <description>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s desktop, mobile or a smart home device with a screen, every operating system needs a web browser, and while Fuchsia OS already uses some of Chromium&amp;rsquo;s code, Google is preparing to bring Chrome and all its features to Fuchsia OS.
As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>
