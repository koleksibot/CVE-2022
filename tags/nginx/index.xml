      <title>Nginx&#39;s shared memory management - the slab algorithm</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/nginx-slab/</link>

      <description>I first learned about the slab algorithm when I was learning the Linux kernel. The kernel uses the Buddy System algorithm to manage memory pages. But for small objects, it would be wasteful to use a page allocator, so slab was born. The kernel&amp;rsquo;s kmalloc() is managed using slab. nginx&amp;rsquo;s shared memory management uses the same idea, but it is not as complex as slab in the Linux kernel. slab</description>

      <description>Background The company group an end-to-end containerized test environment, located under different sub-paths, proxied by Nginx: * For example, user A is under /a/prometheus/: /a/prometheus/. For example, user A is under /a/: /a/prometheus/ For example, user B under /b/: /b/prometheus/ The effect you want to achieve, in addition to the above distinction between different subpaths, requires that there is no such distinction inside the container: i.e., the container can be</description>

      <title>NGINX proxy gRPC requests</title>

      <description>My blog server has two ports open, one for serving HTTP requests and one for serving gRPC requests from clients. Later, after learning more about gRPC, I found out that the underlying transport layer protocol is actually based on HTTP/2. At the same time, I saw the official NGINX gRPC support. So I wanted to use NGINX to proxy gRPC requests so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to think about the</description>

      <description>Nginx is a web server that acts as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache, and follows a master-slave architecture.
A complicated term and a confusing definition filled with big confusing words, right? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I can help you first understand the basics of the architecture and terminology in Nginx. Then, we&amp;rsquo;ll move on to installing and creating Nginx configurations.
To make things easy, just remember: Nginx is an amazing web server .</description>

      <description>This article documents the use of Filebeat, Kibana, and Elasticsearch to build a system for collecting and analyzing Nginx logs; Filebeat is responsible for delivering Nginx log data as a data source to Elasticsearch. As an introduction, we will first explain the relationship between the software: Elasticsearch is a distributed full-text search and data analysis engine based on RESTful style; Kibana is a web system for visualizing Elasticsearch data; and</description>

      <description>server is an Nginx directive that defines domain-specific settings so that you can run multiple websites on a single server.

      <description>When we use CDN services such as CloudFlare, in addition to the function of saving traffic and speeding up access, an important function is to prevent exposing the real IP of the website, but if your NGINX is not properly configured, direct access to the server&amp;rsquo;s IP using the HTTPS protocol will expose a certificate pointing to a domain name on the server, which will be scanned by some Some services that scan the entire network for IP addresses get the correspondence between the domain name and the IP.</description>

      <description>Since FastDFS distributed file storage does not retain the original file name when uploading files, when the file is uploaded it returns a file ID in the following format, which contains the group the file is in, the secondary directory, and a base64-encoded file name generated from the client&amp;rsquo;s IP, timestamp, and file size. The file ID is stored in the client database and can only be accessed by the</description>

      <description>When using nginx as a reverse proxy, you can simply forward the request directly to the next service as is. Setting a proxy_pass request will only replace the domain name, if you want to access different services based on different url suffixes, you need to go through the following method.

Why switch Most of the time we use a domain name for our production environment, and to ensure isolation we use another domain name for our test environment (test environment buy</description>
