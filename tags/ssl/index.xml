      <description>Previously, I wrote an article on SSL protocol, which introduces the fundamentals of cryptography and gives an overall overview of the SSL protocol. For space reasons, the detailed flow of the SSL handshake was not covered in depth. In this paper, we will disassemble the handshake process and introduce it in detail at the message level. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the basic concepts of cryptography or don&amp;rsquo;t know the basic information of SSL protocol, it is recommended to read the previous article first.</description>

      <description>SSL protocol is an important part of modern network communication, which provides data security at the transport layer. In order to facilitate your understanding, this article will start with the basics of cryptography, and then move on to a detailed explanation of the SSL protocol principles, processes and some important features, and finally will expand on the differences between the national SSL protocols, security and the key new features of TLS 1.</description>

      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>
