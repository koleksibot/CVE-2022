      <description>Containerized applications managed by cloud-native platforms have no control over their lifecycle, and to be good cloud-native , they must listen to events issued by the management platform and adjust their lifecycle accordingly. The hosted lifecycle model describes how applications can and should react to these lifecycle events. Existence of problems health probes we explain why containers provide APIs for different health checks. health check APIs are read-only endpoints that</description>

      <description>Automated Placement is a core feature of the Kubernetes scheduler that is used to assign new Pods to nodes that meet container resource requests and comply with the scheduling policy. This pattern describes the principles of Kubernetes&#39; scheduling algorithm and the way it influences scheduling decisions from the outside. Problems A reasonably sized microservices-based system consists of dozens or even hundreds of independent processes. Containers and Pods do provide good</description>

      <description>The Timed Job mode extends the Batch Job mode by adding a time dimension and allows a unit of work to be executed triggered by an event at that time.
Existence of problems In the world of distributed systems and microservices, real-time and event-driven application interaction using HTTP and lightweight messaging is a clear trend. However, regardless of the latest trends in software development, Job scheduling has a long history and it is still relevant.</description>

      <description>Daemon Service mode allows for scheduling and running high-priority, infrastructure-focused Pods on target nodes. administrators primarily use it to run node-specific Pods to enhance the Kubernetes platform. Existence of problems The concept of daemon processes in software systems exists at many levels. At the operating system level, a daemon is a long-running, self-recovering computer program that runs as a background process. In Unix, daemon names end with a &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo;, such</description>

      <description>The Singleton service pattern ensures that only one instance of an application is active at a time, yet highly available. This pattern can be implemented from within the application, or can be delegated entirely to Kubernetes.
Existence of problems One of the main features provided by Kubernetes is the ability to easily and transparently scale applications. pods can be forced to scale with a single command (e.g. kubectl scale), or declaratively with a controller definition (e.</description>

      <description>1. What this article is about Growth in business volume and evolution of business forms require solid and robust IT systems to support them. Business content is transparent to the market, but IT systems can&amp;rsquo;t be built overnight. The competition between companies in the future will mainly come from the competition between IT systems, and the ability to respond quickly to business needs is the key to victory.

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/kuberentes-federation/</guid>
      <description>Kubernetes has claimed to support 5,000 nodes in a single cluster since an earlier release, and there are no plans to increase the number of nodes supported by a single Kubernetes cluster in the near future. If you need to support more than 5,000 nodes in Kubernetes, Federation is the preferred method of cluster federation.
 People frequently ask how far we are going to go in improving Kubernetes scalability. Currently we do not have plans to increase scalability beyond 5000-node clusters (within our SLOs) in the next few releases.</description>

      <description>1. How to access the remote cluster locally During development, you need to connect to the remote Kubernetes cluster directly. The usual practice is to copy /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf to the local ~/.kube/kubeconfig.
But the server address for kubeconfig is kubernetes.default.svc. Therefore, we need to configure a hosts.

CRD Controller For the CRD (CustomResourceDefinition) itself, it is not too much to understand it as just a Schema of OpenApi, because that is its only ability and role, but for the broader statement: &amp;ldquo;CRD is used to implement xx functions&amp;rdquo;, it is actually the CRD Controller that is responsible for implementing the functions.</description>

      <description>The database used by Open Hackathon is MongoDB, and in containerization, the security of data is a top priority.
Storage issues Stateful applications need to use PersistentVolume when deployed on Kubernetes, but if the underlying PV storage is unreliable, even with PV, data security is still not guaranteed.
In a general usage scenario, the application needs to define a PersistentVolumeClaim to describe the required storage resources and use the PersistentVolumeClaim in the Pod, and the cluster will create or find a PersistentVolumeClaim based on the description in the PersistentVolumeClaim.</description>

      <description>With the release of Kubernetes 1.14, it was discovered that the Yaml management tool kustomize, which was only for the Kube interest group, was integrated into kubectl, so that you can use kubectl apply -k to apply kustomization.yaml from the specified directory to the cluster.
What is kustomize Using the tool definitely starts with figuring out where the tool is located. kustomize (Github link) is described in the code repository as.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is one of the most widely used computational tools for big data analytics today. It excels at batch and real-time stream processing and supports machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data analytics applications. The narrowly defined Hadoop (MR) technology stack is shrinking as Spark becomes more popular and more heavily used. In addition, general opinion and practical experience has proven that Hadoop (YARN) does not have the flexibility to integrate with a broader enterprise technology stack, except for Big Data-related workloads.</description>

      <description>Start with an introduction to k8s knowledge points and common terms.
Master The Master node, the brain of k8s, is the control node of the cluster and is responsible for the management and control of the cluster. All other Nodes register themselves with the Master and report all information about themselves on a regular basis. The following four processes run on the Master node.
 Api Server: The service process that provides the HTTP Rest interface; the only entry point for all resource add, delete, and check operations; the entry point for cluster control, kubectl is directly responsible for the Api Server.</description>

      <description>If resources such as Deployment and DaemonSet take on long, online compute for Kubernetes, then regular, short-term, and even one-time offline compute is what Job and CronJob take on.
Job A Job is actually one or more pods that are defined to execute a task, and when the pod exits after execution, the Job is done. So Job is also called Batch Job, i.e. compute business or offline business.
Job Usage The YAML definition of a Job is very similar to Deployment.</description>

      <description>Most of the authentication mechanisms in K8s are done with ServiceAccount. Although K8s has the concept of User, there is no resource that corresponds to a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;, so it is still very difficult to do user management in K8s. The good thing is that K8s provides an alternative way for user management, which is to interface with the OIDC protocol. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what the OIDC protocol is and how it is used in K8s.</description>

      <description>Service discovery is an important feature of K8s, and there are two ways to do this: either by injecting the svc ClusterIP into the pod as an environment variable, or by using DNS, which has replaced kube dns as the built-in DNS server since version 1.13. In this article, we will briefly analyze coreDNS.
K8s DNS Policies There are four types of DNS policies for Pods in Kubernetes.
 Default: Pod inherits the DNS configuration on the host where it resides.</description>

      <description>As we all know, in the K8s permission management system, you can bind RoleBinding to ServiceAccount, User and Group to achieve permission assignment.
We often use ServiceAccount to restrict the permissions of a pod; for User and Group, there are no specific resources to correspond to them except for some special system groups, which is very unfriendly to the user management in traditional projects.

      <description>There are more and more networking solutions for containers, and with each new solution, it is obviously unreasonable to adapt the networking solution to different container runtimes, and CNI is designed to solve this problem.
While maintaining a &amp;ldquo;home-level Kubernetes cluster&amp;rdquo; at home during holidays, I got the idea to write a network plugin, and developed Village Net based on cni/plugin.

      <description>Kubernetes started out by providing only Extender. The Extender scheduler plugin, which enables non-intrusive extensions by deploying a web service, has several problems.
 The number of Extender extensions is limited: only &amp;ldquo;Filter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Prioritize&amp;rdquo; extensions are available during scheduling. The &amp;ldquo;Preempt&amp;rdquo; extension is called after running the default preemption mechanism. &amp;ldquo;Extender cannot be called at other points, e.g. not before running the predicate function. Performance issues: Each call to an extender involves JSON coding and decoding.</description>

It is very easy to launch a development environment in Kubernetes with one click through Okteto. We have also introduced the Skaffold tool from Google, and today we will demonstrate how to use Okteto to build Python application development environment.
Installation We just need to install the Okteto CLI tool on our local development machine. To use Okteto to configure the environment we need to have access to a Kubernetes cluster on our local machine, so The prerequisite is to configure a kubeconfig file for an accessible Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and Docker has played a pivotal role in containers from its inception to today, and is the default container engine in Kubernetes. However, in December 2020, the Kubernetes community decided to move forward with removing Dockershim-related code from its repositories, which was significant for both the Kubernetes and Docker communities.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure most developers have heard of Kubernetes and Docker and know that we can use Kubernetes to manage Docker containers, but they may not have heard of Dockershim, the Docker shim.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a very complex cluster orchestration system, yet even though it contains rich functionality and features, it cannot meet the needs of all scenarios because of the inherent high complexity of container scheduling and management. While Kubernetes can solve most of the common problems in most scenarios, in order to achieve a more flexible strategy, we need to use the scalability provided by Kubernetes for specific purposes.
Each project will focus on different features at different cycles, and we can simply divide the evolution of the project into three distinct phases.</description>

      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>In this series of articles, we will learn how to use the Elastic technology stack to build a monitoring environment for Kubernetes. The goal of observability is to provide an operations tool for production environments to detect when a service is unavailable (e.g., if the service is down, has errors, or is slow to respond) and to keep some troubleshooting information to help us pinpoint the problem. In summary, there</description>

      <description>In the previous article on how to use GitLab CI for CI/CD in a Kubernetes cluster, we basically used the Docker On Docker model for building images, because the Kubernetes cluster uses a container runtime like Docker, so we could mount the host docker.sock file from the host to the container to build the image, but recently we changed the container runtime to Containerd after using Kubernetes version 1.22.X, so</description>

      <description>As Kubernetes releases iterate, many Helm Chart packages simply cannot keep up with the updates, resulting in many Helm Chart packages being incompatible when using newer versions of Kubernetes, so it is necessary to consider compatibility with different versions of Kubernetes when developing Helm Chart packages.
The core of achieving compatibility with different versions is to make use of the built-in object Capabilities provided by the Helm Chart template, which provides information about Kubernetes cluster support features, including the following features.</description>

      <description>It is very convenient to use kubeadm to install kubernetes cluster, but there is also a more annoying problem is that the default certificate is only valid for one year, so you need to consider the issue of certificate upgrade, the demo cluster version of this article is v1.16.2 version, there is no guarantee that the following operation is also applicable to other versions, before the operation must first backup</description>

      <description>If you use Kubernetes a lot, you should be familiar with Helm and Kustomize. Both tools are used to manage Kubernetes resource lists, but they work in different ways. Helm uses templates, a Helm Chart package that contains a number of templates and value files, and when rendered the variables in the templates are replaced with the corresponding values in the value files. Kustomize uses a template-free approach, which patches</description>
