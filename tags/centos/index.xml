      <title>CentOS execution of grub2-mkconfig causes disk to be read-only</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/centos-grub2-mkconfig/</link>

      <description>I recently encountered a failure where a disk partition was found to become read-only during a cluster software upgrade, causing the storage application to recognize the disk as unavailable. Investigation revealed that the cluster upgrade process regenerates the GRUB configuration file for each node, which causes the disk partition to become read-only during the execution of grub2-mkconfig. Document the flow of the grub2-mkconfig command execution until the real disk read-only command is issued.</description>
