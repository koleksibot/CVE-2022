      <title>Introduction to EDNS Client Subnet Protocol</title>

      <description>DNS systems use plaintext UDP protocol to communicate by default, so the content of users&#39; queries can be easily monitored, and the resolution results returned by servers can be easily tampered with. To solve this problem, technologies such as DNS over HTTPS/TLS/QUIC have been introduced in the hope of transmitting DNS queries in an encrypted manner. However, with the use of public DoH recursive resolution servers, authoritative DNS servers can only get the address of the recursive resolution server, but not the user&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

      <title>DNS Introduction</title>

      <description>We usually use domain names, such as taoshu.in, to access the Internet. But computers need to use IP addresses when they communicate. The core function of DNS is to save the mapping between domain names and IP addresses. Today, we will introduce how DNS works.
In DNS, the core concept is the domain name. A domain name is a way of organizing information hierarchically, somewhat similar to a computer&amp;rsquo;s folders. Take a Windws system for example, the path where user Demo&amp;rsquo;s desktop is located is C:\Users\Demo\Desktop.</description>

      <title>Introduction to DNS SVCB/HTTPS records</title>

      <description>The IETF is introducing a new type of record for DNS called SVCB/HTTPS. this SVCB/HTTPS record can solve some very important problems and I have been following the advancement of the standard. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an introduction.
1987 CNAME records The DNS system first supported CNAME records in 1987 (RFC 1034), which means canonical name in Chinese. For example, we can set the a.example.com record type to CNAME and its value to b.</description>

      <title>Why DNS uses the UDP protocol</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-dns-udp-tcp/</link>

      <description>The specific issue to be analyzed today is &amp;lsquo;why DNS uses the UDP protocol&amp;rsquo;. DNS acts as a phone book for the entire Internet, translating domain names that can be understood by humans into IP addresses that can be understood by machines, eliminating the need for users of the Internet to have direct access to IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand.
I believe that it is common knowledge among software engineers that DNS uses the UDP protocol, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS uses the UDP protocol to transfer data, but this is not entirely true.</description>

      <title>Adding DNS records to Pods</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-10/add-dns-record-for-pod/</link>

      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
 etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>
