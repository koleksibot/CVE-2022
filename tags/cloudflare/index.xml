      <description>Cloudflare proxy HTTPS certificate is too expensive, a wildcard domain name certificate a year to spend at least a couple of thousand. So how to meet the needs of the general public to build a website? Cloudflare is a very good choice. Cloudflare is a CDN provider, can provide reverse proxy for the site. It does this by resolving the domain name to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s server (or proxy), and then the browser uses Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s certificate to establish an SSL connection with the proxy; then the proxy will establish an SSL connection with the target server using a self-signed certificate, and the next data are forwarded by the proxy.</description>
