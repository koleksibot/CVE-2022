      <description>Recently looked up some old Google articles / papers, found that Google has a number of systems on the design of the text are written planet scale, the breath that is really big. When you think about it, FAANG can do business to the global Internet companies, in addition to these five, there are not many other, they do have the capital to blow planet scale. Really envious.
Google&amp;rsquo;s employees came out to start a business, the company name is also TailScale (seems to be doing vpn&amp;rsquo;s), PlanetScale (this seems to be taking vitess out to start a business) so that means ex-googler is also more like the culture of this company.</description>

      <description>Recently I need to use the timed task function in golang, I use a cron library, the current version is v3, the Internet is quite a lot of v2 tutorials, record the use of the method.
In the old version of the library, the default cron expression is not the standard format, the first bit is the definition of the second level. Now the v3 version can use the standard cron expression directly, mainly see the godoc documentation section</description>
