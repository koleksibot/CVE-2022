      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s self-developed Fuchsia operating system is now available as a full Chrome browser experience, a further step towards widespread deployment, according to tech media outlet 9to5Google.
Previously, users have had very limited access to the web on Fuchsia for some time now through the operating system&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Simple Browser&amp;rdquo; app (powered by the Chromium engine). But even so, the &amp;ldquo;browser&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t offer some of the daily necessities such as the address bar or tabs.</description>

      <description>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s desktop, mobile or a smart home device with a screen, every operating system needs a web browser, and while Fuchsia OS already uses some of Chromium&amp;rsquo;s code, Google is preparing to bring Chrome and all its features to Fuchsia OS.
As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>
