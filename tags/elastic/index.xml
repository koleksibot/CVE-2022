      <description>Last November, Israeli startup build.security raised a $6 million seed round of funding led by YL Ventures. Less than a year ago, Elastic recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire build.security for an undisclosed amount, which is expected to close in the second quarter of Elastic&amp;rsquo;s fiscal year 2022.
Once the acquisition is completed, the build.security technology team will serve as a unit within the Elastic Security organization, said Ash Kulkarni, Elastic&amp;rsquo;s chief product officer.</description>
