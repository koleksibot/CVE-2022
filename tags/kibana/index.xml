      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>In this section we will install and configure Filebeat to collect log data from a Kubernetes cluster and send it to ElasticSearch, Filebeat is a lightweight log collection agent that can also be configured with specific modules to parse and visualize the log format of applications (e.g., databases, Nginx, etc.).
Similar to Metricbeat, Filebeat requires a configuration file to set the link information to ElasticSearch, the connection to Kibana, and the way logs are collected and parsed.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will use Metricbeat to monitor Kubernetes clusters, as we have already installed and configured the ElasticSearch cluster in the previous article. Metricbeat is a lightweight collector on the server that is used to collect monitoring metrics for hosts and services on a regular basis. This is the first part of our build of Kubernetes full-stack monitoring. Metribeat collects system metrics by default, but also includes a</description>

      <description>In this series of articles, we will learn how to use the Elastic technology stack to build a monitoring environment for Kubernetes. The goal of observability is to provide an operations tool for production environments to detect when a service is unavailable (e.g., if the service is down, has errors, or is slow to respond) and to keep some troubleshooting information to help us pinpoint the problem. In summary, there</description>
