      <description>1. Aggregate data using Query Thanos Query can interface not only with Thanos Store Gateway, but also with any component that is compatible with Prometheus API. Here is the diagram.
Thanos Query can be interfaced with the following components.
 Thanos Store Gateway Thanos Query Prometheus VictoriaMetrics Prometheus API-compatible components  Using the cascading between Thanos Query, we can implement correlated queries across components to build mega-monitoring systems. This also means that each docked component should provide a fast enough Prometheus API.</description>

      <description>1. layering of monitoring As shown above, two strategies are used when building a monitoring system:
 The advantage of separating IaaS, MySQL middleware, and App tier monitoring is that the systems are highly available and fault-tolerant to each other. When the App tier monitoring does not work, the IaaS tier monitoring will immediately show up. Separation of long and short term metrics. Short-term metrics are used to provide alerting systems with high frequency queries for recent data, and long-term metrics are used to provide people with queries for data sets that span a larger period of time.</description>
