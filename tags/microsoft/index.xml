      <description>Recently, Twitter user Florian said: Microsoft has added some ads to the File Explorer in its Windows 11 Insider preview version.
As the screenshot shows, Microsoft uses such ads to promote other Microsoft products and &amp;ldquo;write confidently in documents, email and on the web with advanced writing suggestions from Microsoft Editor.
The old File Explorer was already a point of criticism for Windows, and Microsoft has worked hard to improve the ease of use and appearance of its default File Explorer, such as the recently added &amp;ldquo;tabs&amp;rdquo; feature that opens multiple folder tabs like a browser.</description>

      <title>Microsoft proposes to add type annotation to JavaScript natively</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/microsoft-type-annotations-for-javascript/</link>

      <description>Microsoft has put forward a new proposal to bring an optional type syntax to JavaScript, which could make JavaScript natively come with some of the features of TypeScript, making the TypeScript language faster and easier to use.
Specifically, the proposal calls for Type Annotations to be added to JavaScript code, allowing type annotations to be checked by external type checkers. At runtime, the JavaScript engine would ignore these annotations and treat these types as annotations.</description>

      <description>research from Google&amp;rsquo;s security research team, Project Zero, shows that Linux developers are more effective at fixing security vulnerabilities more quickly than anyone else (including Google).
From 2019 to 2021, Project Zero reported a total of 376 issues to vendors within the standard 90-day period.]351 (93.4%) of these bugs have been fixed, 14 (3.7%) have been flagged by the vendor as WontFix, and 11 (2.9%) remain unfixed. At the time of the bulletin, 8 had sometimes passed their fix deadlines; the remaining 3 were still within their fix deadlines.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for averaging unsigned integers by rounding? A recent article by Raymond Chen, a Microsoft engineer, has been a direct hit on the technology platform, sparking numerous discussions. Countless people clicked in with unbridled confidence: isn&amp;rsquo;t it just a simple elementary school programming problem of adding and dividing by two? 1 2 3 4 unsigned average(unsigned a, unsigned b) { return (a + b) /</description>

      <description>Starting with Exchange Server 2013, Microsoft enables the FIP-FS anti-spam and anti-malware scanning engine by default to protect users from malicious emails. However, starting at midnight on January 1, 2022, a unique way of storing dates in the FIP-FS engine caused a bug that blocked email delivery from Microsoft Exchange on-premise servers.
On January 1, 2022, the first day of the new year, Twitter user &amp;ldquo;long wtf = 2201010001&amp;rdquo; tweeted @msexchangeteam said that the FIP-FS &amp;ldquo;Microsoft&amp;rdquo; scan engine failed to load and could not convert &amp;ldquo;2201010001&amp;rdquo; to long type.</description>

      <description>Last June, Microsoft announced that it was working with hardware vendors on a project called TensorFlow-DirectML, which provides GPU-accelerated training of machine learning (ML) models on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). After a year of previews, the project has now ended its preview and released its official version.
As the name implies, TensorFlow-DirectML is a fork of TensorFlow that includes both Google&amp;rsquo;s TensorFlow machine learning platform and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s DirectML API.</description>

While it is currently only available for Azure, Microsoft developers are working to make it compatible with other cloud service providers.
Cloud Katana is built on top of Azure Functions, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s serverless computing solution. the idea behind Cloud Katana is to run &amp;ldquo;simulations&amp;rdquo; to test cloud security, as well as hybrid cloud security.</description>

      <description>Starting in September, Microsoft will no longer support its Android Office apps on Chromebooks. Instead, Microsoft will recommend that these users use its web-based Office.com and Outlook.com apps from 18 September.
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s suite of Office apps arrived on Android devices back in 2015, and regular updates since then have brought a host of new features to the apps. After this date, Microsoft will continue to offer native Office apps for other Android devices, a move that is just one of the limitations Microsoft has placed on Chrome OS.</description>

      <description>Microsoft and Google are working on a new API for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge called &amp;ldquo;VirtualKeyboard&amp;rdquo; that updates the on-screen keyboard for typing on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Android and provides better control.
According to the documentation, Virtual Keyboard (VK) is a public JavaScript API that puts control of the on-screen keyboard in the hands of Web developers. As it stands now, developers have very limited control over VK, and the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s performance is not ideal for scenarios where developers want users to use a website&amp;rsquo;s built-in keyboard to enter passwords on Android.</description>

      <title>Microsoft to disable JavaScript JIT to improve Edge security</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-08/edge-super-duper-secure-mode/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-08/edge-super-duper-secure-mode/</guid>
      <description>Microsoft Edge vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman revealed that the team is experimenting with a new feature in Edge that disables the JavaScript JIT compiler to enable some additional security protection. They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>
