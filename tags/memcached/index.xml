      <description>Memcached is the oldest in-memory caching server. Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support as rich a data structure as Redis, Memcached is used less and less. But I think Memcached is a great example of the Unix philosophy of doing one thing at a time and doing it well. And Memcached is focused on the one thing that is memory caching. This is best demonstrated by the introduction of Meta Commands in Memcached in version 1.</description>

      <description>When you think of Redis, you think of Memcached, and vice versa. Those who know both have a general impression that Redis supports simple key-value data types compared to Memcached, and also provides storage for data structures such as list, set, zset, and hash; redis supports data backup, redis supports data persistence, and it looks like redis is more powerful than memcached. The redis support for data backup, redis support for data persistence, looks redis than memcached more awesome, so in fact is this not the case?</description>
