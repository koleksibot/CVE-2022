      <description>Pine64 (the company behind the Pinebook Pro and PinePhone) announced will launch the PineNote, a high-end e-ink screen device based on the Quartz64 single-board computer. The company says the PineNote is one of the most powerful e-ink devices on the market; it can be used as an open-source alternative to more expensive counterparts such as Remarkable 2 and Onyx BOOX.
According to the description, the PineNote is powered by the RK3566 quad-core A55 system chip paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 memory and 128GB of eMMC flash memory.</description>
