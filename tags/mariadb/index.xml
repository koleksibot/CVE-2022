      <description>MariaDB, an open source database company said, plans to become a public company with the help of Angel Pond Inc.
Based in Helsinki, Finland, MariaDB originally emerged as an offshoot of MySQL. This was because the founders of the MySQL project had concerns about its independence after Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008.
MariaDB&amp;rsquo;s CTO was Michael Widenius, one of the founders of MySQL, and MariaDB was named after Widenius&#39; youngest daughter.</description>
