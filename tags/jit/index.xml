      <description>James Gosling, the Canadian computer scientist who did the original design of Java and implemented the compiler and virtual machine for the original version of Java, is also widely regarded as the &amp;lsquo;father of Java&amp;rsquo;.
James Gosling was recently interviewed by Grigory Petrov, a technical evangelist (DevRel) at Evrone, an enterprise software development company.
In this interview James Gosling talks a lot about programming languages, such as his views on the new features of modern programming languages, how he feels about the disruptive changes caused by updates to programming languages, why not all programming languages use JIT techniques and much more.</description>

      <title>Microsoft to disable JavaScript JIT to improve Edge security</title>

      <description>Microsoft Edge vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman revealed that the team is experimenting with a new feature in Edge that disables the JavaScript JIT compiler to enable some additional security protection. They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>
