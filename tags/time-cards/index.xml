      <description>Facebook shared yesterday the hardware and software design of its &amp;ldquo;Time Cards&amp;rdquo;, a device used to keep its massive data centers running at peak efficiency. This timekeeping technology, based on extremely accurate atomic clocks and navigation satellites, will ultimately help speed up the various services that operate at the scale of the Internet.
Every computing device needs to know what time it is. With the dimension of time, the device can properly provide various services and record various types of logs; without it backups will fail, financial transactions will go wrong, and many basic network services will not work.</description>
