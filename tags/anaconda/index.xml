      <description>Pyston has officially posted that its team (Marius and Kevin) will join Anaconda and continue development of the Python open source interpreter Pyston.
Pyston was originally developed by Dropbox as a Python implementation based on the open source JIT, but Dropbox later abandoned Pyston. eventually, its developers decided to start their own business a few years later and released Pyston 2.0. while Anaconda is a well-known Python and R distribution with a simplified package management strategy, focusing on scientific computing, among other tasks.</description>
