      <description>On August 10, 2021, ExPressVPN announced on their official blog that they are open-sourcing their latest Lightway protocol so that more people can enjoy the benefits of Lightway, a next-generation VPN protocol developed by ExpressVPN to provide users with a faster, more secure, and more reliable VPN experience.
Origin of Lightway While the major VPN vendors have been using protocols like OpenVpn, IKEv2, IPsec, WireGuard, etc., ExpressVPN, an industry giant, decided to try their hand at developing a new VPN protocol on their own, Lightway, after stating that they would not be using WireGuard.</description>
