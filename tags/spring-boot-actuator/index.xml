      <description>Recently, we have been particularly disturbed by various security vulnerabilities, and we have received dozens of vulnerability emails scanned by the security team in a week, which have a class of vulnerabilities that are easy to ignore, but have an extremely wide impact and are extremely harmful, and you should not be unfamiliar with my name, which is Spring Boot Actuator.
Before writing this article, I did a little survey with my friends asking them about their knowledge of the Spring Boot Actuator and the results were surprisingly consistent, everyone knows that Spring Boot provides automatic configuration of the spring-boot-starter-actuator, but very few people but few people actually use its related features.</description>
